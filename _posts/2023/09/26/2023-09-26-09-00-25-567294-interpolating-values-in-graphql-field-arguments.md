In GraphQL, field arguments are used to filter and limit the data returned by a query. Instead of hardcoding the argument values, you can use interpolation to make your queries more flexible and dynamic.

To interpolate values in field arguments, you can use variables. Variables in GraphQL are declared in the query and then passed in as arguments when executing the query.

Here's an example of how to use interpolation in a GraphQL query:

```graphql
query GetBooks($category: String!) {
  books(category: $category) {
    title
    author
    publicationDate
  }
}
```

In this example, we have a query `GetBooks` that accepts a variable `$category` of type `String!`. We pass this variable as an argument to the `books` field, which filters the returned data based on the category.

When executing this query, you would provide the value for the `$category` variable. For example:

```graphql
{
  "category": "fiction"
}
```

The GraphQL server will then interpolate the value of the `$category` variable into the query and return the books in the "fiction" category.

This technique allows you to build more dynamic and reusable queries. You can easily change the argument values without modifying the query itself.

Interpolating values in GraphQL field arguments is a powerful feature that takes advantage of GraphQL's declarative nature and schema introspection capabilities. It enables you to create more flexible and adaptable queries, making your GraphQL API even more powerful.
