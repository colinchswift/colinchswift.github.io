Lazy quantifiers, denoted by the question mark followed by a question mark (?), match as few characters as possible. This makes them ideal for interpolating dynamic values into regex patterns.

Let's say you have a string that follows a specific pattern, where a number is followed by a word:

```
1 apple, 2 oranges, 3 bananas
```

If you want to extract the numbers from this string, you can use a lazy quantifier to interpolate the numbers into the regex pattern. Here's an example in Python:

```python
import re

text = "1 apple, 2 oranges, 3 bananas"
pattern = r"\d+?"

numbers = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(numbers)  # Output: ['1', '2', '3']
```

In this example, the regex pattern `\d+?` matches one or more digits lazily. This means it will match the minimum number of digits necessary to fulfill the pattern. By using the `findall()` function from the `re` module, we can extract all the matching numbers from the text.

Lazy quantifiers are particularly useful in scenarios where the length of the interpolated value may vary. For example, if you want to extract email addresses from a block of text:

```python
import re

text = "Contact us at abc@example.com or xyz@example.com"
pattern = r"\b\w+@\w+?\.\w+"

emails = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(emails)  # Output: ['abc@example.com', 'xyz@example.com']
```

In this case, the regex pattern `\b\w+@\w+?\.\w+` matches email addresses by lazily quantifying the components of the address. The `\b` ensures that the match begins and ends with a word boundary, and `\w+?` matches one or more word characters lazily.

Using lazy quantifiers allows you to effectively interpolate dynamic values into regex patterns, making your regex more flexible and powerful. However, it's important to note that excessive use of lazy quantifiers may also lead to suboptimal performance in large texts.
