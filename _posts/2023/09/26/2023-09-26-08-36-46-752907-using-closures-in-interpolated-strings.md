In many programming languages, **interpolated strings** are a convenient way to combine variables or values with plain text. They allow you to embed expressions within a string, making your code more readable and concise. One powerful feature of interpolated strings is the ability to use **closures** to perform dynamic computations during string interpolation.

### What are closures?

A **closure** is a programming concept that allows you to encapsulate a block of code, along with its surrounding state, into a single entity. This entity can then be passed around and executed elsewhere in your code. Closures are commonly used when you need to define **anonymous functions** or when you want to capture values from the surrounding context.

### Using closures in interpolated strings

Let's say you have a requirement to generate a greeting message based on the time of day. With closures, you can easily achieve this using interpolated strings.

```swift
let getTimeOfDayMessage: () -> String = {
    let hour = Calendar.current.component(.hour, from: Date())
    
    if hour < 12 {
        return "Good morning"
    } else if hour < 18 {
        return "Good afternoon"
    } else {
        return "Good evening"
    }
}

let greetingMessage = "\(getTimeOfDayMessage()), John! Welcome back."
print(greetingMessage)
```

In this example, we define a closure `getTimeOfDayMessage` that captures the current hour using the `Calendar` API. Based on the hour, the closure returns an appropriate greeting message. The closure is then evaluated and the result is inserted into the interpolated string using the `\(closure)` syntax.

When executed, this code will display a personalized greeting message that depends on the time of day.

### Benefits of using closures in interpolated strings

- **Dynamic content**: Closures allow you to generate content on the fly, giving you the flexibility to include dynamic values within your strings.
- **Reusable code**: Since closures are self-contained entities, they can be defined once and reused in multiple places. This promotes code reusability and reduces duplication.
- **Readability**: Interpolated strings with closures make your code more expressive and readable, as the logic for generating content is kept close to where it's actually used.

### Conclusion

Using closures in interpolated strings is a powerful technique that enables you to generate dynamic content within your strings. The flexibility and reusability offered by closures can greatly improve the readability and maintainability of your code. Next time you need to combine variables with text, consider leveraging closures in interpolated strings to make your code more concise and expressive.
