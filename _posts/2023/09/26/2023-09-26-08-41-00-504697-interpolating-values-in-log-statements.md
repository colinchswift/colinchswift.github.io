Let's take a look at an example in Python:

```python
import logging

def calculate_sum(a, b):
    logging.info(f"Calculating the sum of {a} and {b}")
    return a + b

result = calculate_sum(5, 7)
logging.info(f"The sum is {result}")
```

In the code snippet above, we import the logging module and define a `calculate_sum` function that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`. Inside the function, we use an `info` log level to print a log message that includes the interpolated values of `a` and `b` using an `f-string`. This allows us to display the actual values being used in the calculation.

After calling the `calculate_sum` function and storing the result in the `result` variable, we log another message using the interpolated value of `result`. This helps us verify the correct result without the need for additional print statements or manual inspection.

When executed, the log statements will output something like:

```
INFO:root:Calculating the sum of 5 and 7
INFO:root:The sum is 12
```

Interpolating values in log statements provides context and helps us understand what is happening within our code. It also proves helpful when debugging or investigating issues, as we can see the actual values being used at runtime.

Remember to use the appropriate log level (such as `info`, `debug`, `warning`, or `error`) based on the severity of the message. This ensures that log statements are properly categorized and can be filtered if necessary.
