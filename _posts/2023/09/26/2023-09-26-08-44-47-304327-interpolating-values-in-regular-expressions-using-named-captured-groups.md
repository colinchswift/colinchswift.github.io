Regular expressions are a powerful tool in pattern matching and extracting information from text. One useful feature of regular expressions is the ability to capture specific parts of a matched pattern. This can be achieved using capturing groups in the form of parentheses `( )`.

In addition to capturing groups, regular expressions also support *named captured groups*. Named captured groups make it easier to refer to specific captured values later on. They can be especially helpful when it comes to interpolating values within a regular expression.

To define a named captured group, we can use the syntax `(?<name>pattern)`. Here, `name` represents the name of the captured group, and `pattern` is the regular expression pattern to match.

Let's take a look at an example to understand how we can interpolate values using named captured groups in regular expressions:

```python
import re

# We want to match a date pattern in the format "dd-mm-yyyy"
text = "Today's date is 07-12-2022"

# Define the regular expression pattern with named captured groups
pattern = r"Today's date is (?P<day>\d{2})-(?P<month>\d{2})-(?P<year>\d{4})"

# Match the pattern against the text and extract the captured values
match = re.match(pattern, text)

# Access the captured values using the groupdict() method
if match:
    day = match.groupdict()['day']
    month = match.groupdict()['month']
    year = match.groupdict()['year']

    print(f"Day: {day}")
    print(f"Month: {month}")
    print(f"Year: {year}")
```

In this example, we define a regular expression pattern that matches the date pattern `"dd-mm-yyyy"`. We use named captured groups to capture the day, month, and year values separately. The named captured groups are accessed using the `groupdict()` method, which returns a dictionary containing the names and corresponding captured values.

By using named captured groups, we can easily interpolate the captured values into other strings or patterns as needed, providing a convenient way to work with and manipulate the extracted information.

# Conclusion

Named captured groups in regular expressions are a powerful feature that allows us to interpolate and work with specific captured values more easily. By giving each captured group a name, we can refer to the captured values by their names, making our code more readable and maintainable.

Using named captured groups in regular expressions can greatly enhance our ability to process and extract information from text, making them a valuable tool in any developer's toolbox.
