GraphQL aliases allow you to request the same field multiple times in a single query with different arguments. This can be useful when you want to retrieve different pieces of data from a field based on different conditions. However, there may be cases where you need to dynamically interpolate values in aliases, i.e., make the alias name itself a dynamic value. In this blog post, we'll explore how to achieve this in GraphQL.

## What are GraphQL Aliases?

In GraphQL, aliases are used to assign different names to the same field in a query. This is particularly helpful when you have a query with multiple fields of the same type and need to differentiate the results. Aliases are denoted by prefixing the field with the desired name followed by a colon.

```graphql
query {
  getUserById: user(id: "123") {
    name
    email
  }
  getUserByUsername: user(username: "example") {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

In the above example, we're using aliases to request user data based on different criteria.

## Static Aliases vs Dynamic Aliases

Static aliases have fixed names that don't change during runtime. However, there may be scenarios where you need to generate aliases dynamically based on some variables. For instance, let's consider a case where we want to retrieve data for multiple users using aliases named after their usernames.

To achieve this, you can use GraphQL variables and a combination of fragments in your query. Fragments allow you to extract reusable parts of a query and combine them dynamically.

Here's an example of how you can dynamically interpolate values in aliases using variables and fragments:

```graphql
query GetUsers($usernames: [String!]!) {
  users {
    ...UserFields
  }
}

fragment UserFields on User {
  name
  email
  ...FieldsAlias
}

fragment FieldsAlias on User {
  id: id
  firstName: name
  ${"username"}: username
}
```

In this query, we pass an array of usernames as a variable `$usernames`. We then use fragments to define the fields we want to retrieve and assign aliases to them using interpolation.

By dynamically setting the `${"username"}` value, we can generate aliases based on the usernames provided as variables. This allows us to retrieve data for multiple users using dynamically generated aliases.

## Conclusion

GraphQL aliases enable you to request the same field multiple times with different arguments. While aliases are typically static, there may be situations where you need to dynamically interpolate values to generate aliases. By leveraging GraphQL variables and fragments, you can achieve dynamic alias generation and retrieve the desired data more efficiently.
