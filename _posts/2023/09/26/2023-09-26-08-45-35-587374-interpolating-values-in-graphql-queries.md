Interpolation can be extremely useful when you need to dynamically pass values to your GraphQL queries. It allows you to make your queries more flexible and reusable by changing the values at runtime.

To interpolate values in a GraphQL query, you need to define variables in your query and then pass their values when making the actual request. Let's take a look at an example:

Suppose you have a GraphQL query to retrieve information about a specific user:

```graphql
query GetUser($userId: ID!) {
  user(id: $userId) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

In this query, we have defined a variable called `userId` of type `ID!`. The exclamation mark denotes that it is a required field.

To interpolate the `userId` variable, you would pass its value when making the GraphQL request. Here's an example using the Apollo Client in JavaScript:

```javascript
import { gql, ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';

const GET_USER = gql`
  query GetUser($userId: ID!) {
    user(id: $userId) {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
`;

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://api.example.com/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

const userId = '123456';
client.query({
  query: GET_USER,
  variables: { userId },
})
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data.user);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

In this code snippet, we import the necessary packages and define our GraphQL query using the `gql` template literal. We then create an instance of the `ApolloClient` and pass the GraphQL endpoint URL and a cache object.

We define the `userId` variable with a value of `'123456'` and make the GraphQL query using the `client.query` method. We pass the `GET_USER` query and the `variables` object containing the `userId` variable.

Upon receiving the response, we log the user data to the console.

Interpolating values in GraphQL queries provides a powerful way to customize your queries at runtime, making your applications more flexible and adaptable. Embrace this feature to enhance the performance and efficiency of your GraphQL API integration.
