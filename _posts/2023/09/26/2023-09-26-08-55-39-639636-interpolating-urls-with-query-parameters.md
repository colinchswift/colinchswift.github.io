In this example, let's assume we have a base URL `https://example.com/api/data`, and we want to add query parameters to it dynamically. 

One common way to achieve this is by using string interpolation, which allows us to insert variables or expressions into a string. In most modern programming languages, string interpolation is supported, making it easy to construct URLs with query parameters.

Let's demonstrate this concept with an example in Python:

```python
base_url = 'https://example.com/api/data'
page = 1
limit = 10

# Interpolate the URL with query parameters
url = f'{base_url}?page={page}&limit={limit}'

print(url)
```

In this example, we have a base URL, `https://example.com/api/data`, and two query parameters, `page` and `limit`. Using string interpolation, denoted by the `f` prefix before the string, we can insert the values for the `page` and `limit` variables into the URL.

The resulting URL will be `https://example.com/api/data?page=1&limit=10`, where the values for `page` and `limit` are dynamically added.

By using string interpolation, we can easily construct URLs with query parameters, allowing for the flexibility to generate different URLs based on different conditions or user inputs.

Using this approach, you can easily create URLs with query parameters in various programming languages, such as JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, and more, by adjusting the syntax accordingly.
