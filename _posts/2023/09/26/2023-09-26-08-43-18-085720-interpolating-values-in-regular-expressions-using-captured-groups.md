Regular expressions are a powerful tool for manipulating and matching strings. One common use case is to extract specific portions of a string using captured groups. We can then interpolate these captured values into new strings using various programming languages and frameworks. In this blog post, we will explore how to perform value interpolation using captured groups in regular expressions.

## What are captured groups? ##

Captured groups in regular expressions allow us to define and extract specific portions of a matched string. We can surround a part of our regular expression pattern with parentheses `( )` to create a captured group. This allows us to target specific sections of the input string for further processing.

For example, let's say we have the following input string: `'My email is example@example.com'`. If we want to extract the email address, we can create a captured group around the email pattern like this: `'My email is (.*?)'`. Here, `(.*?)` is the captured group that matches any character lazily until it finds the first match. The captured value will be stored for further use.

## Interpolating captured values in different languages ##

### JavaScript ###

In JavaScript, we can interpolate captured values using the `replace` function, which accepts a regular expression and a replacement string or function. To access the captured value inside the replacement string, we can use the `$n` notation, where `n` is the index of the captured value.

```javascript
const inputString = 'My email is example@example.com';
const capturedEmail = inputString.replace(/My email is (.*?)/, 'Email: $1');
console.log(capturedEmail); // Output: Email: example@example.com
```

### Python ###

Python provides the `re` module for working with regular expressions. We can use the `re.sub` function to replace matched patterns with a replacement string. Similar to JavaScript, we can use `\n` notation to access captured values, where `n` is the index of the captured value.

```python
import re

input_string = 'My email is example@example.com'
captured_email = re.sub(r'My email is (.*?)', r'Email: \1', input_string)
print(captured_email)  # Output: Email: example@example.com
```

### Ruby ###

In Ruby, we can use the `gsub` method to perform value interpolation using captured groups. We can access the captured values using the `\\n` notation, with `n` representing the index of the captured value.

```ruby
input_string = 'My email is example@example.com'
captured_email = input_string.gsub(/My email is (.*?)/, 'Email: \\1')
puts captured_email  # Output: Email: example@example.com
```

## Conclusion ##

Using captured groups in regular expressions allows us to extract specific values from strings. We can then interpolate these captured values into new strings using various programming languages and frameworks. This technique provides a powerful and flexible way to manipulate and transform text data, opening up a wide range of possibilities for data processing and analysis.
