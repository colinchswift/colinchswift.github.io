In Swift, **string interpolation** is a powerful feature that allows you to include the values of variables or expressions directly within a string. It provides a concise and readable way to combine string literals with variable values. 

To perform string interpolation in Swift, you can use the **\\(variableName)** syntax within a string literal. Here's an example:

```swift
let name = "John"
let age = 25

let message = "My name is \(name) and I am \(age) years old."
print(message)
```
Output:
```
My name is John and I am 25 years old.
```

In the code above, we have defined two variables `name` and `age`. We then use string interpolation to include their values within the `message` string. The variables are enclosed within backslashes and parentheses `\\(variableName)`. 

String interpolation not only works with variables, but also with expressions. You can perform calculations or call functions within the interpolation syntax. Here's an example:

```swift
let length = 5
let width = 3

let area = length * width

let result = "The area of the rectangle is \(area) square units."
print(result)
```
Output:
```
The area of the rectangle is 15 square units.
```

In this example, we calculate the area of a rectangle using the variables `length` and `width`. We then use string interpolation to include the value of `area` within the `result` string.

String interpolation can be used in various contexts, such as when printing messages, constructing URLs, or generating dynamic content. It helps to make your code more concise and allows for easy readability.

Remember to use string interpolation when you need to combine variable values or expressions within a string in Swift. It's a handy feature that makes string manipulation more efficient and straightforward.
