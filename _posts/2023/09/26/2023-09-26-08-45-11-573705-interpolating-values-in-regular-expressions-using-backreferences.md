Backreferences allow us to refer to previously matched groups within a regular expression and use their values in subsequent operations. To create a backreference, we use the backslash `\` followed by a number or a name. The number corresponds to the order in which the capturing group was defined, starting from 1.

Let's take a look at an example to better understand how backreferences work. Suppose we have a string that contains a list of names in the format "last_name, first_name". We want to swap the position of the first and last name using a regular expression.

```python
import re

name = "Doe, John"

pattern = r"(\w+), (\w+)"
replacement = r"\2 \1"

new_name = re.sub(pattern, replacement, name)

print(new_name)  # Output: "John Doe"
```
In the example above, we use the `re.sub()` function from the `re` module to perform the substitution. The pattern `r"(\w+), (\w+)"` matches a word followed by a comma and a space, and then another word. By using capturing groups, we can refer to the first and last names as `\1` and `\2`, respectively, in the replacement string.

In the replacement string `r"\2 \1"`, we use the backreferences `\2` and `\1` to swap the positions of the first and last names. The resulting string "John Doe" is printed as the output.

Backreferences can also be referenced by name instead of number if you are using named capturing groups. This can make your regular expressions more readable and maintainable. To use named backreferences, you specify a `(?P<name>...)` pattern in your regular expression and then refer to it using `\g<name>` in the replacement string. Here's an example:

```python
import re

name = "Doe, John"

pattern = r"(?P<last_name>\w+), (?P<first_name>\w+)"
replacement = r"\g<first_name> \g<last_name>"

new_name = re.sub(pattern, replacement, name)

print(new_name)  # Output: "John Doe"
```

In this case, we use the `(?P<last_name>\w+)` and `(?P<first_name>\w+)` syntax to create named capturing groups for the last and first names, respectively. The replacement string uses the `\g<name>` syntax to reference the named backreferences.

Using backreferences in regular expressions allows us to perform powerful text manipulations by referring to previously matched groups. Whether using numbered or named backreferences, this feature is an essential tool in regex-based operations. Remember to leverage this feature to make your regular expressions more flexible and efficient.
