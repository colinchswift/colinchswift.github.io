Template literals, denoted by backticks (`), allow you to embed expressions within a string. By using placeholders `${expression}`, you can interpolate variables or even entire UI components into the string. This technique is often used in frameworks like React or Vue.js to create dynamic and reusable UI templates.

Here's an example in JavaScript using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const UserMessage = ({ username }) => {
  return (
    <p>
      Welcome back, <strong>{username}</strong>! 
      {` `}
      {username === 'admin' && <span>You have admin privileges.</span>}
    </p>
  );
};

export default UserMessage;
```

In this example, the `UserMessage` component receives a `username` prop. The JSX code inside the `return` statement demonstrates string interpolation and conditional rendering. The `<strong>{username}</strong>` part interpolates the `username` prop value within the string, making it bold using the `<strong>` element.

The following part `{username === 'admin' && <span>You have admin privileges.</span>}` conditionally renders the `<span>` element based on whether the `username` is equal to `'admin'`. If the condition is true, the interpolated UI component is rendered; otherwise, it is skipped.

By using template literals and JSX, we can seamlessly incorporate UI components within strings, enabling us to generate dynamic and personalized user interfaces.
