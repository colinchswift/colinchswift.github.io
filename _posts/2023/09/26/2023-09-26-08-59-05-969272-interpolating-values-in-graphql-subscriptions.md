In GraphQL, subscriptions allow you to receive real-time updates from the server when certain events occur. However, sometimes you may need to dynamically interpolate values into your subscription queries. This can be useful when you want to filter the subscription results based on specific criteria.

In this blog post, we will explore how to interpolate values into GraphQL subscriptions using examples.

## Syntax for Subscriptions in GraphQL

Before we dive into interpolation, let's quickly review the basic syntax for defining a subscription in GraphQL:

```graphql
subscription {
  eventName {
    field1
    field2
    ...
  }
}
```

The `eventName` here corresponds to the name of the event you are subscribing to. Inside the braces, you define the fields you want to receive updates for.

## Interpolating Values in Subscriptions

To interpolate values into a GraphQL subscription, you can use variables. Variables allow you to pass values from your client application to the server at runtime.

Let's say we have a subscription that notifies us whenever a new comment is posted on an article. We want the subscription to be dynamic, so we can specify the article ID for which we want to receive updates.

```graphql
subscription ($articleID: ID!) {
  newComment(articleID: $articleID) {
    id
    content
  }
}
```

In the example above, `$articleID` is the variable that we plan to interpolate. Notice the `!` after the `ID` type, which means the variable is non-null (required).

## Executing Interpolated Subscriptions

To execute the interpolated subscription, you need to pass the variable values along with the subscription query. Here's an example using the Apollo Client library in JavaScript:

```javascript
import { ApolloClient, gql, InMemoryCache } from "@apollo/client";

const client = new ApolloClient({
  // Apollo Client configuration options
});

const subscriptionQuery = gql`
  subscription($articleID: ID!) {
    newComment(articleID: $articleID) {
      id
      content
    }
  }
`;

const variables = {
  articleID: "123456",
};

const subscription = client.subscribe({
  query: subscriptionQuery,
  variables,
}).subscribe({
  next: (result) => {
    // Handle subscription updates here
    console.log(result.data.newComment);
  },
  error: (err) => {
    // Handle subscription errors here
    console.error(err);
  },
});

// To unsubscribe from the subscription:
subscription.unsubscribe();
```

In the code above, we define the subscription query with the interpolated variable (`$articleID`). We then pass the query and the corresponding variable values to the `subscribe` method of the Apollo Client. Finally, we handle the subscription updates and errors using the `next` and `error` callbacks.

## Conclusion

Interpolating values into GraphQL subscriptions allows you to make your subscription queries more dynamic and flexible. By using variables, you can pass values from your client application to the server at runtime, filtering the subscription results based on specific criteria.

By understanding and leveraging this concept, you can build real-time applications that provide tailored updates to your users based on their preferences and requirements.
