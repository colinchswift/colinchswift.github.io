To interpolate HTML code in a string, you can use templating engines or JavaScript template literals. Here, we'll focus on using JavaScript template literals, as they provide a simple and efficient way to interpolate HTML code.

Template literals in JavaScript allow you to embed expressions within a string literal, using the `${expression}` syntax. When used with HTML code, this syntax helps to create dynamic HTML content.

Consider the following example:

```javascript
const name = "John Doe";
const age = 30;

const html = `
  <div>
    <h1>Hello, ${name}</h1>
    <p>You are ${age} years old.</p>
  </div>
`;

console.log(html);
```

In the code snippet above, we define two variables `name` and `age`. We then use these variables within the HTML code using the `${}` syntax. The resulting HTML code is assigned to the `html` variable.

When we log the `html` variable, it will output:

```html
<div>
  <h1>Hello, John Doe</h1>
  <p>You are 30 years old.</p>
</div>
```

As you can see, the variables `name` and `age` are interpolated within the HTML code, resulting in dynamic content.

Interpolating HTML code in a string using JavaScript template literals provides a cleaner and more readable way to generate dynamic HTML content. It allows you to combine HTML elements and variables seamlessly, making your code more manageable.

Using this technique, you can create dynamic HTML templates, build UI components, or generate HTML emails easily.
