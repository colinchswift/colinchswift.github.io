When working with variables in programming, there may be instances where you need to combine multiple variables into a single string. One way to achieve this is by using string interpolation. String interpolation allows you to embed variables directly within a string, making it easier to create complex and dynamic output.

Let's take a look at an example in Python:

```python
name = "John Doe"
age = 25
city = "New York"

output = f"My name is {name}, I am {age} years old, and I live in {city}."
print(output)
```

In this example, we have three variables `name`, `age`, and `city`. By using the `f` prefix before the string, we can directly embed the values of these variables within the string using curly braces `{}`. The final string is stored in the `output` variable and then printed to the console.

The output of the code snippet above will be:

```
My name is John Doe, I am 25 years old, and I live in New York.
```

By combining the variables within the string using string interpolation, we can create a more readable and concise code compared to traditional concatenation methods.

String interpolation is not limited to Python; many programming languages support it in different forms. For example, in JavaScript, you can use template literals:

```javascript
const name = "John Doe";
const age = 25;
const city = "New York";

const output = `My name is ${name}, I am ${age} years old, and I live in ${city}.`;
console.log(output);
```

The output in JavaScript will be the same as the Python example.

In conclusion, using string interpolation allows you to combine multiple variables into a single string, making your code more readable and efficient. It is a powerful feature available in various programming languages, helping you create dynamic output seamlessly.
