JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely used data format for storing and transmitting data. It provides a simple and readable structure consisting of key-value pairs. The keys in a JSON object are typically static, meaning they remain the same throughout the structure. 

However, in some scenarios, it may be necessary to dynamically generate or interpolate JSON keys based on the values available at runtime. This can be useful when working with data that has variable attributes or when constructing dynamic queries.

In this blog post, we will explore different techniques to interpolate values in JSON keys using various programming languages.

## JavaScript

JavaScript provides a convenient way to interpolate values in JSON keys using the ES6 template literal syntax. 

```javascript
const key = 'attribute';
const value = 'example';
const obj = {
  [`${key}_${value}`]: 'Interpolated Value'
};

console.log(obj); 
// { "attribute_example": "Interpolated Value" }
```

Here, we define a `key` and a `value` variable. Using square brackets and the dollar sign `$`, we construct a dynamic key by interpolating the values into the object literal. The resulting JSON object will have the key `"attribute_example"` with the value `"Interpolated Value"`.

## Python

In Python, we can achieve JSON key interpolation by creating a dictionary and dynamically generating the key-value pairs.

```python
import json

key = 'attribute'
value = 'example'
obj = { f'{key}_{value}': 'Interpolated Value' }

print(json.dumps(obj))
# {"attribute_example": "Interpolated Value"}
```

Here, we utilize string interpolation by prefixing the string with the letter `f`. We construct the key by combining the `key` and `value` variables using the underscore `_`. The resulting JSON string will have the key `"attribute_example"` with the value `"Interpolated Value"`.

## Ruby

In Ruby, we can interpolate values in JSON keys by simply constructing a hash and dynamically generating key-value pairs.

```ruby
require 'json'

key = 'attribute'
value = 'example'
obj = { "#{key}_#{value}": 'Interpolated Value' }

puts obj.to_json
# {"attribute_example":"Interpolated Value"}
```

Using string interpolation with the `#{}` syntax, we create dynamic keys by combining the `key` and `value` variables with an underscore `_`. The resulting JSON object will have the key `"attribute_example"` with the value `"Interpolated Value"`.

## Conclusion

Interpolating values in JSON keys allows us to dynamically generate keys based on the values available at runtime. This can be helpful when dealing with dynamic data or constructing queries. By utilizing language-specific features like template literals, string interpolation, or hash creation, we can easily interpolate values in JSON keys in different programming languages.
