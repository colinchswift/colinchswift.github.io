GraphQL is a powerful query language that allows you to retrieve specifically tailored data from your server. One useful feature of GraphQL is the ability to use inline fragments to conditionally select fields based on the type of the object being queried.

Inline fragments help you handle polymorphic types efficiently. They allow you to define different fields to be selected based on the type of the object being queried. This is particularly useful when you have a union or interface type, as it allows you to access specific fields that are unique to each type in the union or interface.

One common scenario is when you want to interpolate values in inline fragments to get more granular control over the returned data. Let's explore how you can achieve this in GraphQL.

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax for inline fragments in GraphQL is as follows:

```graphql
... on TypeName {
  field1
  field2
  # additional fields specific to TypeName
}
```

Here, `TypeName` refers to the specific type name that you want to target. Inside the inline fragment, you can include fields that are specific to that type. This allows you to access and manipulate the relevant data.

## Interpolating Values

To interpolate values in a GraphQL inline fragment, you can use variables. Variables allow you to pass dynamic values to your query.

Here's an example to illustrate how you can interpolate values in an inline fragment using variables:

```graphql
query GetUserInfo($userId: ID!) {
  user(id: $userId) {
    name
    ... on Admin {
      permissions
    }
    ... on Customer {
      subscription
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, we are querying the `user` field and conditionally selecting different fields based on the type of the user. If the user is of type `Admin`, we will retrieve the `permissions` field, and if the user is of type `Customer`, we will retrieve the `subscription` field.

The `$userId` variable is used to dynamically select a user based on its ID.

## Conclusion

Interpolating values in GraphQL inline fragments allows you to selectively retrieve data based on the type of the object being queried. This can be particularly useful when you have polymorphic types with unique fields for each type.

By utilizing variables, you can dynamically pass values to your query and tailor the response to your specific requirements.
