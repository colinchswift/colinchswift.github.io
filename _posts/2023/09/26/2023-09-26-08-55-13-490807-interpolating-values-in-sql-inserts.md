SQL is a powerful language for managing and manipulating relational databases. One common task in SQL is inserting data into a table. When inserting values into SQL statements, you may need to interpolate variables or dynamic values into the statement.

Interpolation is a technique that allows you to insert values or variables into a string or SQL statement. In the context of SQL inserts, interpolation refers to dynamically inserting values into the insert statement.

Let's take a look at an example. Suppose you have a `users` table with columns `name`, `age`, and `email`. You want to insert a new user into the table with the following values:

- Name: John Doe
- Age: 25
- Email: johndoe@example.com

To interpolate these values into an SQL insert statement, you can make use of placeholders. Different database systems have different syntax for placeholders, but the common ones include question marks (`?`) or named placeholders like `:name`, `:age`, `:email`.

Here's an example using placeholders with question marks for the `users` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, age, email) VALUES (?, ?, ?);
```

Next, you need to supply the actual values for the placeholders. This can be done using programming language-specific techniques. For instance, in Python, you can use a library such as `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL or `pyodbc` for Microsoft SQL Server to execute the SQL statement and provide the values as parameters:

```python
import psycopg2

connection = psycopg2.connect(database="mydatabase", user="myuser", password="mypassword", host="localhost")
cursor = connection.cursor()

name = "John Doe"
age = 25
email = "johndoe@example.com"

cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, age, email) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)", (name, age, email))

connection.commit()
cursor.close()
connection.close()
```

In this example, the `%s` placeholders are used to match the values in the corresponding tuple `(name, age, email)`.

Remember to properly sanitize user input and use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks when interpolating values into SQL inserts.

By leveraging interpolation and placeholders, you can dynamically insert values into SQL insert statements, making your code more flexible, maintainable, and secure.
