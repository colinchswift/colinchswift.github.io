## Why interpolate values?

When a user encounters an error, they need as much relevant information as possible to understand the problem and take appropriate action. By including dynamic values in error messages, you can provide context-specific details that help diagnose the issue quickly. Interpolating values can also improve the user experience, making error messages more human-readable and relatable.

## How to interpolate values effectively

To interpolate values into error messages, follow these best practices:

1. **Identify key variables**: Determine the variables or data points that are crucial to understanding what caused the error. These could include user input, system configurations, or specific data values.

2. **Use placeholders**: Instead of hardcoding values directly into the error message, use placeholders that will be replaced with the actual values at runtime. This allows for flexibility and customization.

   For example:
   ```
   Error: Invalid input for field '{field}'. Please provide a valid {inputType}.
   ```

3. **Format consistently**: Make sure the format of the interpolated value matches the surrounding text. This helps to create a cohesive and professional error message.

4. **Escape characters**: If the interpolated value includes special characters or formatting, ensure that you handle escaping correctly. This prevents any unexpected behavior or confusion.

5. **Handle missing values**: anticipate scenarios where certain variables might be missing or unavailable. In such cases, you can fallback to default values or provide a generic error message that still communicates the issue clearly.

## Conclusion

Interpolating values in error messages is a simple yet powerful technique that can greatly enhance the effectiveness and user-friendliness of your application. By providing context-specific details, users can better understand the cause of the error and take appropriate action. Keep these best practices in mind when designing your error messages to create a better user experience.
