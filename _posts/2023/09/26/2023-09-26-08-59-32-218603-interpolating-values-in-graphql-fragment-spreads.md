## Understanding Fragment Spreads

Before we dive into interpolation, let's have a quick refresher on fragment spreads in GraphQL. Fragment spreads are defined using the `...` syntax followed by the name of the fragment. Here's an example:

```graphql
fragment UserInfo on User {
  id
  name
  email
}

query GetUser($userId: ID!) {
  user(id: $userId) {
    ...UserInfo
  }
}
```

In the example above, we define a `UserInfo` fragment that contains the fields `id`, `name`, and `email`. We then include this fragment spread in the `GetUser` query, which retrieves user information.

## Interpolating Values in Fragment Spreads

In some cases, you may need to dynamically change the values inside a fragment spread. This is especially useful when you have a shared fragment that requires different input parameters based on the context where it is used. Unfortunately, GraphQL does not have built-in support for interpolating values in fragment spreads. However, there are a few workarounds you can use.

### 1. Inline Fragments

One way to achieve value interpolation is by using inline fragments. Inline fragments allow you to conditionally apply a fragment spread based on a certain condition. You can take advantage of this feature to pass different input values when including the fragment. Here's an example:

```graphql
query GetUser($userId: ID!, $includeEmail: Boolean!) {
  user(id: $userId) {
    ...UserInfo
    ...(if: $includeEmail) {
      email
    }
  }
}
```

In the example above, we introduce a `includeEmail` variable that determines whether to include the `email` field or not. By using an inline fragment with the `if` directive, we conditionally include the `email` field based on the value of the variable.

### 2. Variable Assignment

Another workaround is to assign the desired values to variables and use those variables inside the fragment spread. Here's an example:

```graphql
query GetUser($userId: ID!, $fields: [String!]!) {
  user(id: $userId) {
    ...UserInfo
    ...FieldsInfo
  }
}

fragment FieldsInfo on User {
  id
  name
  ${(fieldNames) => fieldNames.join('\n')}
}
```

In the example above, we introduce a `$fields` variable that contains an array of field names. Inside the `FieldsInfo` fragment, we dynamically interpolate the field names using a JavaScript function that joins the array elements with a newline character. This allows us to include any fields defined in the `$fields` variable.

## Conclusion

While GraphQL does not natively support interpolating values in fragment spreads, we explored two workarounds to achieve this functionality. By using inline fragments or variable assignment, you can dynamically change the values inside fragment spreads to meet your specific needs. Remember to consider the trade-offs and choose the approach that best fits your use case.
