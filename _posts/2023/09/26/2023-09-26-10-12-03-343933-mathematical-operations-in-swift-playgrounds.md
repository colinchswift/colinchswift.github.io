Mathematical operations are fundamental in programming, and Swift provides several operators to perform arithmetic calculations. In this post, we will explore the different mathematical operations available in Swift Playgrounds.

## Addition

The addition operator (`+`) is used to add two numbers together. For example:

```swift
let sum = 5 + 3
print(sum) // Output: 8
```

## Subtraction

The subtraction operator (`-`) is used to subtract one number from another. For example:

```swift
let difference = 10 - 2
print(difference) // Output: 8
```

## Multiplication

The multiplication operator (`*`) is used to multiply two numbers together. For example:

```swift
let product = 4 * 3
print(product) // Output: 12
```

## Division

The division operator (`/`) is used to divide one number by another. For example:

```swift
let quotient = 15 / 5
print(quotient) // Output: 3
```

## Modulus

The modulus operator (`%`) is used to find the remainder after dividing one number by another. For example:

```swift
let remainder = 12 % 5
print(remainder) // Output: 2
```

## Increment and Decrement

Swift also provides increment (`+=`) and decrement (`-=`) operators to increase or decrease the value of a variable by a specified amount. For example:

```swift
var count = 5
count += 2 // Increment count by 2
print(count) // Output: 7

count -= 3 // Decrement count by 3
print(count) // Output: 4
```

## Conclusion

Swift Playgrounds provides a wide range of mathematical operators to perform common arithmetic calculations. By utilizing these operators, you can easily manipulate and calculate numbers in your Swift programs. With practice, you'll become proficient in using them efficiently.
