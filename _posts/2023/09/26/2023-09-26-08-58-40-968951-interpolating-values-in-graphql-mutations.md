When working with GraphQL mutations, it is common to perform operations that require dynamic values. Interpolating values allows you to inject variables or dynamic data into your mutation queries. This can be useful for scenarios such as creating new records with user-provided data or updating existing records with variable values.

In GraphQL, you can interpolate values using variables. Variables serve as placeholders that can be replaced with actual values at runtime. To use variables in mutations, you need to define them in the operation's input arguments and assign values to them when executing the mutation.

Let's consider an example where we have a `createUser` mutation that creates a new user record with a username and email. We'll use variables to interpolate these values.

```graphql
mutation CreateUser($username: String!, $email: String!) {
  createUser(username: $username, email: $email) {
    id
    username
    email
  }
}
```

In the above mutation, we define two variables `username` and `email` with their respective types (`String!`). The exclamation mark indicates that the variables are required and must be provided when executing the mutation.

To execute this mutation with values, you need to pass the variables along with the mutation query. Here's an example using the popular GraphQL client Apollo:

```javascript
import { gql, useMutation } from '@apollo/client';

const CREATE_USER = gql`
  mutation CreateUser($username: String!, $email: String!) {
    createUser(username: $username, email: $email) {
      id
      username
      email
    }
  }
`;

function CreateUserForm() {
  const [createUser, { data }] = useMutation(CREATE_USER);

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    const { username, email } = event.target.elements;
    createUser({ variables: { username: username.value, email: email.value } });
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" />
      <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" />
      <button type="submit">Create User</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

In the code snippet above, we define the `CREATE_USER` mutation query using the `gql` tag from `@apollo/client`. When the form is submitted, we extract the `username` and `email` values from the form inputs and pass them as variables to the `createUser` mutation.

By interpolating values in GraphQL mutations using variables, you can create more dynamic and flexible operations. This allows your clients to pass in different values based on their needs, making your application more powerful and adaptable.
