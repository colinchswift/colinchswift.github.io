Regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern matching and string manipulation. One useful feature is the ability to interpolate values dynamically within a regular expression. In this blog post, we will explore how to accomplish this using negative lookaheads.

## What is interpolation in regular expressions?

Interpolation is the process of dynamically inserting values into a regular expression pattern. This can be useful when you want to match patterns that are based on dynamic input. For example, if you want to match a specific word followed by a number, you can interpolate the word into the regular expression pattern to create a dynamic match.

## Using negative lookaheads for interpolation

Negative lookaheads are a type of non-capturing group in regular expressions that allow you to assert the absence of a specific pattern. By combining negative lookaheads with interpolation, you can create powerful regular expressions that match patterns based on dynamic values.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use negative lookaheads for interpolation:

```python
import re

def match_pattern(word):
    pattern = fr"{word}(?!\d)"
    text = "apple orange 123 cherry banana"

    matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
    return matches

words = ["apple", "orange", "cherry", "banana"]
for word in words:
    matches = match_pattern(word)
    print(f"Matches for {word}: {matches}")
```

In the code above, we define a function `match_pattern` that takes a `word` as input. We then use an interpolated regular expression pattern that matches the `word`, but only if it is not followed by a digit. The `(?!\d)` syntax is a negative lookahead that asserts the absence of a digit immediately after the `word`.

We then call the `match_pattern` function for each word in the `words` list. The output will show the matches for each word in the given text.

## Conclusion

Interpolating values in regular expressions using negative lookaheads provides a flexible and powerful way to match patterns based on dynamic input. By combining regular expressions with interpolation and negative lookaheads, you can write more expressive and adaptable code. Experiment with this technique in your own projects to create more robust pattern matching solutions.
