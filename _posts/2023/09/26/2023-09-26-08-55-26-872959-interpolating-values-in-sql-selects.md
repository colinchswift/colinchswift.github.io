In most SQL databases, the syntax for string interpolation requires using a placeholder in the form of a question mark (?) or a colon followed by a variable name (:variable_name). These placeholders will be replaced with the actual values when the query is executed.

Let's take a look at an example in MySQL:

```sql
SET @country = 'France';

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE country = @country;
```

In this example, we use the `@country` variable to store the value 'France'. We then interpolate this value into the `WHERE` clause of the `SELECT` statement using the `=` operator. When the query is executed, the value of `@country` will be substituted, and the query will retrieve all customers from France.

Similarly, in PostgreSQL, you can use the colon syntax:

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
    country text := 'Germany';
BEGIN
    EXECUTE format('SELECT * FROM customers WHERE country = %L', country);
END $$;
```

In this example, we declare a variable `country` and set it to 'Germany'. We then use the `EXECUTE` statement with the `format` function to interpolate the value of `country` into the `SELECT` query.

String interpolation allows you to dynamically insert variable values into your SQL queries, making them more flexible and adaptable. It is especially useful when working with dynamic user inputs or when you need to build complex queries on the fly.
