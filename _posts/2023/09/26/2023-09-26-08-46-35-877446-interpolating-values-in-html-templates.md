When building dynamic web applications, it is common to use HTML templates that allow us to insert dynamic data into our web pages. One way to achieve this is by interpolating values in HTML templates.

Interpolation refers to the process of inserting a value or variable into a string. In the context of HTML templates, interpolation allows us to dynamically insert data into specific locations within the template.

## How to Interpolate Values in HTML Templates

There are several ways to interpolate values in HTML templates, depending on the technology or framework you are using. In this blog post, we will explore two popular methods: using server-side rendering (SSR) and using client-side rendering (CSR).

### Server-side Rendering (SSR)

In SSR, the HTML template is rendered on the server and sent as a complete HTML document to the client. The server-side code can inject the dynamic values into the template before sending it to the client.

Here's an example using JavaScript and Node.js:

```javascript
const name = "John Doe";
const template = `<h1>Hello, ${name}!</h1>`;
```

In this example, the value of `name` is interpolated into the template using the `${}` syntax within the backticks. The final rendered HTML will replace `${name}` with the actual value of `name`.

### Client-side Rendering (CSR)

In CSR, the HTML template is initially rendered on the client-side using JavaScript. The dynamic values are fetched from the server or manipulated on the client-side, and then inserted into the template.

Here's an example using JavaScript and the DOM API:

```javascript
const name = "John Doe";
const template = document.createElement('h1');
template.textContent = `Hello, ${name}!`;
document.body.appendChild(template);
```

In this example, a new `<h1>` element is created using the `document.createElement()` method. The value of `name` is interpolated into the `textContent` property of the element. Finally, the element is appended to the `<body>` element.

## Conclusion

Interpolating values in HTML templates is an essential technique when building dynamic web applications. Whether you're using server-side rendering or client-side rendering, interpolation allows you to insert dynamic data into your web pages.

By using the appropriate interpolation method for your technology stack, you can create more personalized and dynamic web experiences for your users.
