There are several ways to interpolate values in SQL queries, depending on the database system you're working with. Let's explore a few common methods using examples.

1. Using CONCAT function: 
   ```sql
   SELECT CONCAT('Welcome, ', first_name, ' ', last_name, '!') AS greeting
   FROM users
   WHERE user_id = 123;
   ```
   In this example, we use the CONCAT function to dynamically concatenate the values of `first_name` and `last_name` with the static string 'Welcome, '.

2. Using string concatenation operator: 
   ```sql
   SELECT 'Hello ' || first_name || ' ' || last_name AS greeting
   FROM users
   WHERE user_id = 123;
   ```
   Here, we can use the double pipe (`||`) operator to concatenate the string literals with the column values. 

3. Using parameterized queries: 
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users
   WHERE user_id = :user_id;
   ```
   Parameterized queries provide a secure and efficient way to interpolate values in SQL queries. The specific syntax may vary depending on the database system and programming language you're using. In this example, `:user_id` is a placeholder that can be populated with the actual value using prepared statements or query bindings.

Remember to use appropriate precautions while interpolating values in SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Closely follow the best practices recommended by your database system or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library.

By leveraging these techniques, you can dynamically build SQL queries based on the specific needs of your application, providing a more flexible and customizable approach to working with data in your database.
