SQL updates allow you to modify data in a database table. Often, you'll need to use dynamic values in your update statements, which can be achieved by interpolating values. Interpolating values in SQL updates helps to make your queries flexible and dynamic.

To interpolate values in an SQL update statement, you can use placeholders and bind the actual values to those placeholders. The specific syntax and techniques may vary slightly depending on the database management system (DBMS) you are using. However, the fundamental concept remains the same.

Here's an example to illustrate how to interpolate values in an SQL update using placeholders:

```sql
UPDATE employees 
SET salary = :new_salary, last_updated = :current_date
WHERE employee_id = :employee_id;
```

In this example, we're updating the "salary" and "last_updated" columns in the "employees" table. We use placeholders (e.g., ":new_salary", ":current_date", and ":employee_id") to represent the dynamic values that will be bound later.

To interpolate the values into the update query, you'll use a programming language or a DBMS-specific tool. Let's assume we're using Python with a database connector library, such as `psycopg2`.

Here's an example of how you can interpolate values using Python and `psycopg2`:

```python
import psycopg2

# Connect to the database
conn = psycopg2.connect(database="your_database", user="your_username", password="your_password", host="your_host", port="your_port")

# Create a cursor object
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Define the values to be interpolated
new_salary = 50000
current_date = '2022-12-31'
employee_id = 123

# Execute the update query with interpolated values
cursor.execute("UPDATE employees SET salary = %s, last_updated = %s WHERE employee_id = %s", (new_salary, current_date, employee_id))

# Commit the transaction
conn.commit()

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
conn.close()
```

In this Python example, we use the `%s` placeholder syntax provided by `psycopg2`. We pass the respective values as a tuple as the second argument to the `execute()` method. The placeholder values will be bound to the corresponding placeholders in the update query.

By interpolating values, you can make your SQL update statements more dynamic and adaptable to different scenarios. This technique is useful when you need to update database records based on user input or values obtained from other sources.

Remember to properly validate and sanitize any user input or external values to prevent SQL injection attacks.
