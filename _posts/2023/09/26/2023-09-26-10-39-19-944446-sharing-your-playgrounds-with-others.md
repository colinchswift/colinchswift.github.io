When working on coding projects, it can be helpful to share your work with others for collaboration or feedback. Fortunately, there are several ways you can easily share your coding playgrounds with others. In this article, we will discuss a few popular methods to make your coding projects accessible to others.

### 1. GitHub

GitHub is a widely-used platform for hosting and sharing code repositories. By creating a GitHub repository for your coding playground, you can easily share your work with others. To get started, follow these steps:

1. Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one.
2. Create a new repository by clicking on the "New" button on the top-right corner of your GitHub dashboard.
3. Choose a relevant name for your repository and make it public.
4. Initialize the repository with a README file and optionally add a .gitignore file and a license.
5. Upload your playground files to the repository by either cloning it locally or using the web-based file uploader.
6. Once your files are uploaded, others can access your playground by visiting the repository's URL.

### 2. CodePen

CodePen is an online code editor and playground that allows you to easily share your front-end web development projects. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for coding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To share your CodePen playground:

3. Write your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in the provided editor.
4. Customize the presentation and layout of your playground using the settings panel on the left side.
5. Save your Pen and share the URL with others.

CodePen also allows you to collaborate with others in real-time, making it a great option for team projects or coding workshops.
