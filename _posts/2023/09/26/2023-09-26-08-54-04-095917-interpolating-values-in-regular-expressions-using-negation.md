Let's say we have a string that contains a placeholder "{{name}}" and we want to replace it with the actual name. We can do this using the negation technique in regular expressions.

```python
import re

# Define the pattern with the placeholder
pattern = r"{{name}}"

# Define the substitution value
name = "John Doe"

# Use regex substitution to replace the placeholder with the value
updated_string = re.sub(pattern, name, input_string)

# Print the updated string
print(updated_string)
```

In the above code, we use the `re.sub()` function from the `re` module in Python to substitute the placeholder in the `input_string` with the `name` value. The `pattern` variable contains the regular expression pattern with the placeholder `{{name}}`.

Note that regular expressions are case sensitive by default. If you want to make the interpolation case-insensitive, you can modify the pattern as `pattern = r"{{name}}(?i)"`.

It's important to be cautious when interpolating values in regular expressions, as some special characters may have a meaning in regex patterns. If the value you want to interpolate contains special characters, it's recommended to escape them using the `re.escape()` function before performing the substitution.

Using regular expression interpolation with negation, you can easily replace placeholders in strings with actual values. This technique is useful in various scenarios, such as template rendering, text generation, or data processing. #regex #interpolation
