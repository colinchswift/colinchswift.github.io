In XML, a CDATA section allows us to include blocks of text that should be interpreted as raw data by the parser. This means that any special characters (such as angle brackets or ampersands) within a CDATA section are treated as literal text and not parsed as XML markup.

To interpolate values within a CDATA section, we can make use of string formatting or templating techniques offered by various programming languages. Let's take a look at an example in Python:

```python
xml_template = '''
<data>
    <message>
        <![CDATA[Hello {name}, welcome to {platform}!]]>
    </message>
</data>
'''

name = "John"
platform = "Tech Blog"

xml_content = xml_template.format(name=name, platform=platform)

print(xml_content)
```

In the above code, we have an XML template containing a CDATA section. The placeholder `{name}` and `{platform}` within the CDATA section will be replaced with the values of the `name` and `platform` variables using the `format()` method.

The output will be:

```xml
<data>
    <message>
        <![CDATA[Hello John, welcome to Tech Blog!]]>
    </message>
</data>
```

By leveraging string formatting or templating techniques, we can easily interpolate values into CDATA sections in XML files. This allows for more dynamic and personalized content within XML documents.
