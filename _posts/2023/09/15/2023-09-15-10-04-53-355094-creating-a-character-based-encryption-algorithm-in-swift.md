When it comes to encrypting data, there are various algorithms available, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. In this blog post, we will explore how to create a character-based encryption algorithm using Swift.

## Designing the Encryption Algorithm

The first step in creating our encryption algorithm is to design the encryption logic. We will be using a simple substitution cipher, where each character in the plaintext message is replaced with another character. This replacement will be based on a predefined mapping of characters.

To make our algorithm customizable, we will allow the user to provide their own character mapping. This mapping will be a dictionary, where the keys are the plaintext characters and the corresponding values are the encrypted characters.

Here's an example of a character mapping:

```swift
let characterMapping: [Character: Character] = [
    "A": "Q",
    "B": "W",
    "C": "E",
    // Rest of the mapping...
]
```

## Encrypting the Message

With the character mapping in place, we can now proceed to encrypt the plaintext message. The encryption process involves iterating over each character in the message and replacing it with the corresponding encrypted character from the mapping.

Here's an example function that performs the encryption:

```swift
func encrypt(message: String, characterMapping: [Character: Character]) -> String {
    var encryptedMessage = ""
    
    for character in message {
        if let encryptedCharacter = characterMapping[character] {
            encryptedMessage.append(encryptedCharacter)
        } else {
            encryptedMessage.append(character)
        }
    }
    
    return encryptedMessage
}
```

To use this function, you can simply call it with the plaintext message and the character mapping:

```swift
let plaintextMessage = "Hello, World!"
let encryptedMessage = encrypt(message: plaintextMessage, characterMapping: characterMapping)
print(encryptedMessage)
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to create a character-based encryption algorithm in Swift. By implementing a substitution cipher and allowing custom character mappings, we can create a flexible encryption algorithm that can be used to secure sensitive data.

Remember, it's important to note that this encryption algorithm is quite basic and may not provide strong security. It is important to use well-established encryption algorithms in real-world scenarios where strong security is required.
