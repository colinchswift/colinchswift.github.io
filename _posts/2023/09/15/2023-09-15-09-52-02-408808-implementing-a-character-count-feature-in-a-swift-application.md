## Step 1: Setting up the project

First, let's create a new Swift project or open an existing one. Make sure you have a text input control, such as a `UITextField` or `UITextView`, where the user can enter their text.

## Step 2: Adding the character count functionality

To implement the character count feature, we need to handle the user input and update the character count in real time. One way to achieve this is by using the delegate pattern.

1. Begin by conforming to the `UITextFieldDelegate` or `UITextViewDelegate` protocols in your view controller:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, UITextFieldDelegate {
    // ...
}
```

2. Set your view controller as the delegate for the text input control in the `viewDidLoad` method:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    textField.delegate = self // replace textField with your text input control
}
```

3. Implement the `shouldChangeCharactersIn` method to handle the text input. This method is called whenever the text changes in the input control:

```swift
func textField(_ textField: UITextField, shouldChangeCharactersIn range: NSRange, replacementString string: String) -> Bool {
    // Get the current text and update it with the new string
    let updatedText = (textField.text as NSString?)?.replacingCharacters(in: range, with: string) ?? ""

    // Update the character count
    let characterCount = updatedText.count

    // Do whatever you need with the character count (e.g., display it on the UI)
    characterCountLabel.text = "\(characterCount)"

    // Return true to accept the text change
    return true
}
```

In this example code, we update the `characterCountLabel` with the current character count. You can replace it with your own logic to handle the character count.

## Step 3: Displaying the character count

Now that we have the character count, we need to display it to the user. You can add a label or any other UI element to show the character count on the screen.

```swift
@IBOutlet weak var characterCountLabel: UILabel!
```

Make sure to connect the outlet in your storyboard or XIB file.

## Step 4: Testing the character count feature

Build and run your application. Now, when you enter text in the input control, the character count will be updated in real time.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to implement a character count feature in a Swift application. By using the delegate pattern and handling the text input changes, we were able to update the character count in real time. This feature can be useful in various scenarios where text limits need to be enforced. Feel free to enhance the implementation based on your specific requirements. Happy coding!
