Sorting strings in Swift can be a useful operation, especially when dealing with large amounts of data or when the order of strings is important. While Swift provides built-in sorting methods, sometimes we may need to sort strings based on specific character properties like case sensitivity or diacritic marks. In this blog post, we will explore techniques for sorting strings based on character properties in Swift.

## Sorting Strings With Case Sensitivity

By default, the Swift `String` type performs case-sensitive comparison when sorting. However, there may be cases where we want to sort strings in a case-insensitive manner. Thankfully, Swift provides an easy solution for this.

We can use the `localizedStandardCompare` method from the `NSString` class to perform a case-insensitive comparison when sorting strings. This method takes into account language-specific rules for string comparison, which can be helpful when sorting strings in different languages.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates sorting an array of strings in a case-insensitive manner:

```swift
let strings = ["apple", "Banana", "CARROT", "date"]
let sortedStrings = strings.sorted { $0.localizedStandardCompare($1) == .orderedAscending }

print(sortedStrings)   // Output: ["apple", "Banana", "CARROT", "date"]
```

## Sorting Strings With Diacritic Insensitivity

Diacritic marks, such as accents or umlauts, can affect the sorting order of strings. For example, in English, "café" should come after "cab", but with a case-sensitive sorting algorithm, it would typically come before.

To sort strings without taking diacritic marks into account, we can use the `localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare` method from the `NSString` class. This method performs a case-insensitive and diacritic-insensitive comparison.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates sorting an array of strings in a diacritic-insensitive manner:

```swift
let strings = ["café", "cab", "bath", "Blåbær"]
let sortedStrings = strings.sorted { $0.localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare($1) == .orderedAscending }

print(sortedStrings)   // Output: ["bath", "Blåbær", "cab", "café"]
```

## Conclusion

In Swift, sorting strings based on character properties like case sensitivity or diacritic marks is easy. By utilizing the `localizedStandardCompare` and `localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare` methods from the `NSString` class, we can customize the sorting behavior to suit our needs.

Remember to consider these techniques when dealing with string sorting in your Swift projects. By doing so, you can ensure that your sorting operations are accurate and tailored to the specific requirements of your application.
