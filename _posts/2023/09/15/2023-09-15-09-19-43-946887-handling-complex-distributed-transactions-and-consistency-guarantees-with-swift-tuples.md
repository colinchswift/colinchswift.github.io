Distributed transactions are fundamental in building scalable and reliable systems. They allow multiple, independent entities to coordinate their actions as part of a single transaction. However, handling complex distributed transactions can be challenging, especially when it comes to ensuring consistency guarantees across multiple participants.

In the context of Swift programming, one approach to handling complex distributed transactions and ensuring consistency guarantees is by leveraging the power of Swift tuples. Swift tuples are lightweight data structures that allow you to group multiple values together into a single compound value.

Here's an example code snippet showcasing how Swift tuples can be used to handle a complex distributed transaction:

```swift
func processTransaction() {
    let customerState: (Double, String) = (500.0, "active")
    let orderState: (Int, Double) = (12345, 250.0)

    // Perform transactional actions using the tuple values
    deductAmount(from: &customerState.0, amount: orderState.1)
    updateOrderStatus(orderID: orderState.0, status: "completed")

    // Ensure atomicity and consistency
    let newCustomerState: (Double, String) = (customerState.0, "active")
    let newOrderState: (Int, Double) = (orderState.0, 0.0)
    
    // Commit the transaction by updating the tuple values
    customerState = newCustomerState
    orderState = newOrderState
}
```

In the above example, we have a `processTransaction()` function that handles a complex distributed transaction involving a customer and an order. The customer's state is represented by a tuple containing their balance and status, while the order's state is represented by a tuple containing the order ID and amount.

Inside the function, we perform the necessary transactional actions using the values from the tuples. For example, we deduct the order amount from the customer's balance and update the order status.

To ensure atomicity and consistency, we create new tuples (`newCustomerState` and `newOrderState`) with the desired updated values. We then commit the transaction by assigning these new tuples to the original tuples (`customerState` and `orderState`).

By using Swift tuples, we can encapsulate multiple values into a single entity, enabling us to treat those values as a single unit within the context of a distributed transaction. This approach helps in achieving consistency guarantees by ensuring that all the involved entities are updated atomically and consistently.
