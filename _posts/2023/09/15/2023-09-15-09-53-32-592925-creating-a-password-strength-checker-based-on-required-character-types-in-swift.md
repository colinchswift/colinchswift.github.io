In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a password strength checker in Swift. We will be checking the strength of a password based on the required character types such as lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Setting up the Project

1. Open Xcode and create a new Swift project.
2. Name the project "PasswordStrengthChecker" and select a directory to save it.

## Creating the Password Strength Checker

First, let's create a function that checks the strength of a password based on the required character types.

```swift
func checkPasswordStrength(password: String) -> Bool {
    let requiredCharacterTypes: [Character] = ["a"..."z", "A"..."Z", "0"..."9", "!@#$%^&*(){}[]|"]
    
    for type in requiredCharacterTypes {
        if !password.contains(where: { type.contains($0) }) {
            return false
        }
    }
    
    return true
}
```

The above function takes a password as an argument and checks if it contains at least one character from each required character type. If any of the character types are missing, it returns `false`, indicating the password is not strong enough.

## Testing the Password Strength Checker

Now, let's test our password strength checker function.

```swift
let password1 = "Abcd1234!" // Strong password
let password2 = "abcd1234"  // Missing special characters
let password3 = "ABCD1234"  // Missing lowercase letters

let passwords = [password1, password2, password3]

for password in passwords {
    let isStrong = checkPasswordStrength(password: password)
    if isStrong {
        print("\(password) is a strong password")
    } else {
        print("\(password) is not a strong password")
    }
}
```

Running the above code will output:

```
Abcd1234! is a strong password
abcd1234 is not a strong password
ABCD1234 is not a strong password
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a password strength checker in Swift. We implemented a function that checks the strength of a password based on required character types. This can be a useful tool to ensure that users create strong passwords for their accounts.
