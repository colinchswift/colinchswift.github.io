In this tutorial, we will learn how to implement a custom emoji picker in a Swift messaging app. The emoji picker will allow users to easily select and insert emojis into their chat messages.

## Requirements

To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have the following:

1. Xcode installed on your machine.
2. A basic understanding of Swift programming language.
3. A working messaging app project in Swift.

## Step 1: Set up the Emoji Picker UI

To start, let's create a new view controller that will serve as the emoji picker. Add a new file to your project called `EmojiPickerViewController` and set it as the root view controller of a new navigation controller.

Next, design the UI for the emoji picker. You can create a grid of buttons, each representing an emoji. Use a collection view or stack view to manage the layout. Don't forget to add a search bar to allow users to search for specific emojis.

## Step 2: Load Emoji Data

Create a new Swift file called `EmojiDataManager` and define a method called `loadEmojiData` that will load the emoji data. The emoji data can be stored in a JSON file or retrieved from an API.

In the `loadEmojiData` method, parse the JSON data and create an array of emoji objects. Each object should contain the emoji image and its corresponding keyword.

## Step 3: Display Emoji in the Emoji Picker UI

In the `EmojiPickerViewController`, create an instance variable to hold the array of emoji objects. In the `viewDidLoad` method, call the `loadEmojiData` method from the `EmojiDataManager` to load the emoji data.

Once the emoji data is loaded, populate the emoji buttons in the UI with the corresponding emoji images.

## Step 4: Insert Selected Emoji into Chat Message

Now we need to handle the user's selection of an emoji and insert it into the chat message. Add an action method to the emoji buttons in the `EmojiPickerViewController`.

In the action method, retrieve the selected emoji and pass it back to the chat view controller via a delegate or closure. In the chat view controller, append the selected emoji to the input text field or message body.

## Step 5: Use the Emoji Picker

Finally, integrate the emoji picker into your messaging app. Add a button or gesture recognizer to open the emoji picker view controller. When the user taps on the button or triggers the gesture, present the emoji picker modally or push it onto the navigation stack.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to implement a custom emoji picker in a Swift messaging app. We covered setting up the emoji picker UI, loading emoji data, displaying emoji in the emoji picker UI, and inserting selected emoji into the chat message. Now you can enhance your messaging app by allowing users to easily express themselves with emojis! #Swift #iOSProgramming
