Developing an iOS application that allows users to view and select different fonts can be a great way to enhance the user experience. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of creating a custom font viewer and selector in a Swift application.

## Getting Started

First, let's create a new Xcode project and select **Single View App** as the template. Provide a suitable name for your project and choose Swift as the programming language.

## Adding Custom Fonts

To use custom fonts in your application, you need to add the font files to your project. Follow these steps to add custom fonts:

1. In the project navigator, right-click on your project's folder and select **Add Files to "Your Project Name"**.

2. Browse and select the font files that you want to include in your project. Make sure they are checked under **Target Membership** when prompted.

3. Open your project's **Info.plist** file and add a new entry called **Fonts provided by application**. Expand this entry and add an item for each custom font file you added in the previous step.

## Creating the Font Viewer and Selector

Now, let's proceed with creating the font viewer and selector functionality:

1. Open the **ViewController.swift** file and add a `UIFontPickerViewControllerDelegate` to the class declaration line.

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, UIFontPickerViewControllerDelegate {
```

2. Add a button to the view controller's **Main.storyboard**. Set an appropriate title, such as "Select Font", for the button.

3. Create an outlet for the button by Ctrl-dragging from the button to the **ViewController.swift** file. Name the outlet, for example, `fontSelectorButton`.

4. In the **ViewController.swift** file, add an action for the button called `showFontPicker`.

```swift
@IBAction func showFontPicker(_ sender: UIButton) {
    let fontPicker = UIFontPickerViewController()
    fontPicker.delegate = self
    present(fontPicker, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

5. Implement the required delegate method `didPickFont` to handle the font selection.
```swift
func fontPickerViewControllerDidPickFont(_ viewController: UIFontPickerViewController) {
    guard let descriptor = viewController.selectedFontDescriptor else {
        return
    }
    
    let font = UIFont(descriptor: descriptor, size: 17.0)
    // Use the selected font in your application as desired
}
```

6. Build and run your application on a simulator or device. When the "Select Font" button is pressed, the font picker view controller will be presented, allowing users to choose a font.

## Final Thoughts

In this tutorial, we explored the process of creating a custom font viewer and selector in a Swift application. By following these steps, you can empower your users to explore and select their preferred font for a personalized experience.

Remember to consider the user interface and design aspects to make the font selector visually appealing and user-friendly. Play around with additional features like font size adjustment or preview text to further enhance the functionality of your font viewer. Happy coding!
