Dependency Injection (DI) is a popular design pattern in software development that allows for loosely coupled components and better testability. In Swift, DI can be implemented using various approaches, including constructor injection, property injection, and method injection. However, there may be cases where we need to inject dependencies conditionally based on certain criteria. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement conditional dependency injection in Swift.

## The Scenario

Imagine we have a `DataService` protocol and multiple implementations of it, each tailored for a specific data source, such as `LocalDataService`, `RemoteDataService`, and `MockDataService` for testing purposes. Depending on the environment or user settings, we might need to use a specific implementation of `DataService`.

## 1. Defining Conditional Dependencies

To implement conditional dependency injection, we can use Swift's powerful generics and protocols. We will start by defining a protocol that represents a condition:

```swift
protocol Condition {
    associatedtype Value
    func isSatisfied() -> Bool
    func getDependency() -> Value
}
```

This protocol has an associated type `Value` representing the type of the dependency. It also provides methods to check if the condition is satisfied and retrieve the dependency.

Next, we define a protocol that represents the dependency itself:

```swift
protocol DataService {
    // Data-related methods
}
```

We will have multiple implementations of `DataService`, such as `LocalDataService`, `RemoteDataService`, and `MockDataService`.

## 2. Implementing Conditional Resolver

We can now implement a resolver class that resolves the correct implementation of `DataService` based on the condition:

```swift
class DataServiceResolver {
    func resolve<Condition: DependencyCondition>(_ dependencies: [Condition]) -> DataService? {
        for dependency in dependencies {
            if dependency.isSatisfied() {
                return dependency.getDependency()
            }
        }
        return nil
    }
}
```

The `resolve` method takes an array of `DependencyCondition` objects and iterates over them to find the first condition that is satisfied. It returns the corresponding dependency if found, or `nil` if no condition is satisfied.

## 3. Using Conditional Dependency Injection

To use conditional dependency injection, we need to define the conditions and dependencies and then resolve the correct dependency using the resolver. Here's an example:

```swift
let resolver = DataServiceResolver()
let conditions: [DependencyCondition] = [
    // Define conditions and respective dependencies
    EnvironmentCondition<LocalDataService>(environment: .development),
    EnvironmentCondition<RemoteDataService>(environment: .production),
    EnvironmentCondition<MockDataService>(environment: .testing)
]

guard let dataService = resolver.resolve(conditions) else {
    fatalError("Unable to resolve DataService")
}

// Use the resolved DataService
dataService.fetchData()
```

In this example, we define an array of `DependencyCondition`s based on the environment, where each condition is associated with a specific implementation of `DataService`. The resolver will then find the first condition that is satisfied and resolve the corresponding dependency.

## Conclusion

Conditional dependency injection allows us to inject dependencies based on specific conditions, providing flexibility and modularity to our code. By utilizing protocols and generics, we can implement this pattern in Swift and achieve highly adaptable and testable software.
