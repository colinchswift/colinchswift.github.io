Dependency injection is a widely used practice in modern software development, allowing for loosely coupled and testable code. In some cases, you may need to inject different dependencies based on the runtime environment your code is running in. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement conditional dependency injection based on the runtime environment in Swift.

## Understanding Conditional Dependency Injection

Conditional dependency injection allows us to provide different implementations of a protocol or class based on certain conditions. This is especially useful when your code needs to behave differently depending on whether it is running in a development, staging, or production environment.

## Using Swift Compiler Flags

One way to achieve conditional dependency injection in Swift is by utilizing Swift compiler flags. Compiler flags allow you to conditionally include or exclude code during the compilation process based on certain conditions.

For example, let's say we have a protocol called `Logger`:

```swift
protocol Logger {
    func log(message: String)
}
```

We can provide different implementations of this protocol based on the runtime environment. 

First, define a custom compiler flag that represents the current environment. Open your target's build settings and add a new user-defined setting called `RuntimeEnvironment`. Set the value for each environment, such as `development`, `staging`, and `production`, depending on your project's setup.

Next, create different implementations of the `Logger` protocol for each environment. For demonstration purposes, let's create a simple console logger for the development environment and a file logger for the production environment:

```swift
#if development
class ConsoleLogger: Logger {
    func log(message: String) {
        print("[Development]: \(message)")
    }
}
#elseif production
class FileLogger: Logger {
    func log(message: String) {
        // write message to a log file
    }
}
#endif
```
Using the `#if` and `#elseif` compiler directives, we conditionally include the appropriate implementation based on the value of the `RuntimeEnvironment` flag.

## Injecting the Dependency

Now that we have implemented different versions of the `Logger` protocol for each environment, we can inject the appropriate dependency based on the runtime environment.

Let's say we have a class `DataManager` that requires a logger:

```swift
class DataManager {
    let logger: Logger
    
    init(logger: Logger) {
        self.logger = logger
    }
    
    func fetchData() {
        logger.log(message: "Fetching data...")
        
        // Perform data fetching logic
    }
}
```
To inject the logger dependency into the `DataManager`, we need to determine the runtime environment and choose the appropriate logger implementation.

```swift
let runtimeEnvironment = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["RuntimeEnvironment"]
let logger: Logger

if runtimeEnvironment == "development" {
    logger = ConsoleLogger()
} else if runtimeEnvironment == "production" {
    logger = FileLogger()
} else {
    fatalError("Invalid runtime environment")
}

let dataManager = DataManager(logger: logger)
```

In this example, we access the `RuntimeEnvironment` environment variable and select the matching logger implementation accordingly. If the environment variable is unknown or invalid, we raise a fatal error as a safety measure.

## Conclusion

Implementing conditional dependency injection based on the runtime environment is a powerful technique that allows your code to adapt and behave differently in various scenarios. By leveraging Swift compiler flags and runtime checks, you can provide different dependencies to your classes or protocols, ensuring your software remains flexible and configurable.
