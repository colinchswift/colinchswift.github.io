In modern app development, there is a growing emphasis on writing modular and testable code. One key aspect of achieving this is dependency injection, which allows for more flexible and decoupled code architecture. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement dependency injection for camera and photo capture in Swift, using a simple example.

## The Problem

Let's say we have a `CameraViewController` that is responsible for capturing photos using the device's camera. Traditionally, we would directly initialize and use the camera within this view controller. However, this tightly couples the camera logic to the view controller, making it difficult to test and reuse.

## The Solution: Dependency Injection

To address this issue, we can apply dependency injection by introducing a protocol to abstract the camera functionality. Let's call this protocol `CameraService`. Here's an example of how the protocol could look:

```swift
protocol CameraService {
    func capturePhoto(completion: @escaping (UIImage?) -> Void)
}
```

By defining a protocol, we can encapsulate the camera logic and provide a clear interface for capturing photos. Now, let's modify our `CameraViewController` to accept an instance of the `CameraService` protocol through dependency injection.

```swift
class CameraViewController: UIViewController {

    private var cameraService: CameraService
    
    init(cameraService: CameraService) {
        self.cameraService = cameraService
        super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
        
        setupView()
    }
    
    // Rest of the view controller implementation...
}
```

In the above code snippet, we have added a new initializer to the `CameraViewController` that accepts an instance of `CameraService`. This allows us to provide different implementations of the `CameraService` protocol to the view controller as needed.

## Implementing the CameraService Protocol

Let's now implement the `CameraService` protocol with a concrete class `CameraServiceImpl` that directly interacts with the device's camera:

```swift
import AVFoundation

class CameraServiceImpl: CameraService {
    private var captureSession: AVCaptureSession?
    
    func capturePhoto(completion: @escaping (UIImage?) -> Void) {
        // Camera capture logic here...
    }
}
```

Inside the `capturePhoto()` method, you can implement the camera capture logic using `AVFoundation` or any other camera framework of your choice. For brevity, I haven't included the entire logic here, but you can customize it as per your requirements.

## Injecting the CameraService

To utilize the `CameraService`, we need to inject an instance of `CameraServiceImpl` into our `CameraViewController`. There are multiple ways to achieve this, such as using a dependency injection container or manually injecting the dependency when instantiating the view controller.

Here's an example of manually injecting the `CameraServiceImpl` instance into the `CameraViewController`:

```swift
let cameraService = CameraServiceImpl()
let cameraViewController = CameraViewController(cameraService: cameraService)
```

By injecting the `CameraService` implementation into the view controller, we have achieved a more modular and testable codebase. Now, we can easily substitute the `CameraServiceImpl` with a different implementation, such as a mock object for unit testing.

## Conclusion

Implementing dependency injection for camera and photo capture in Swift allows us to decouple the camera logic from our view controllers, making our code more modular and testable. By abstracting the camera functionality into a protocol and injecting its implementation, we achieve code reusability and flexibility. Additionally, our code becomes easier to maintain, as we can easily swap out different implementations of the camera service.
