Dependency injection is a powerful concept in software development that allows for loosely coupled and more maintainable code. In Swift, there are two main approaches to implementing dependency injection: compile-time and runtime.

## Compile-Time Dependency Injection

Compile-time dependency injection is achieved through the use of protocols and generics. The dependencies are defined as protocol requirements, and concrete implementations are provided through generics. This approach has the advantage of catching dependency-related errors at compile-time, making it easier to detect and solve issues before runtime.

Here's an example to illustrate compile-time dependency injection:

```swift
protocol Logger {
    func log(message: String)
}

class ConsoleLogger: Logger {
    func log(message: String) {
        print(message)
    }
}

class Service {
    let logger: Logger
    
    init(logger: Logger) {
        self.logger = logger
    }
    
    func performTask() {
        logger.log(message: "Task performed")
    }
}

let logger = ConsoleLogger()
let service = Service(logger: logger)
service.performTask()
```

In this example, the `Logger` protocol defines the requirement for logging functionality. The `ConsoleLogger` class implements this protocol and provides the concrete logging implementation. The `Service` class has a `logger` property that is injected through its initializer.

## Runtime Dependency Injection

Runtime dependency injection, on the other hand, involves using a dedicated framework or library to manage the dependencies at runtime. These frameworks typically provide container objects that handle the creation and injection of dependencies based on configuration.

Here's an example using the popular Swinject framework for runtime dependency injection in Swift:

```swift
import Swinject

protocol Logger {
    func log(message: String)
}

class ConsoleLogger: Logger {
    func log(message: String) {
        print(message)
    }
}

class Service {
    let logger: Logger
    
    init(logger: Logger) {
        self.logger = logger
    }
    
    func performTask() {
        logger.log(message: "Task performed")
    }
}

let container = Container()
container.register(Logger.self) { _ in ConsoleLogger() }

let service = container.resolve(Service.self)
service?.performTask()
```

In this example, we define our dependencies (in this case, the `Logger` protocol) and register the concrete implementation (`ConsoleLogger`) with the container. The container then resolves the dependencies and injects them into the classes or objects that need them.

## Conclusion

Both compile-time and runtime dependency injection have their own strengths and use cases. Compile-time dependency injection offers more control and safety by catching issues at compile-time, while runtime dependency injection provides flexibility and dynamic behavior through the use of dedicated frameworks or libraries.

By understanding the differences between compile-time and runtime dependency injection in Swift, developers can choose the approach that best suits their project requirements and coding style.
