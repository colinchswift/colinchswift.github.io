Handling deep links can be a crucial aspect of building modern and dynamic iOS applications. Deep links allow users to directly navigate to specific screens within an app from external sources, such as push notifications or URLs. 

One effective way to handle deep links in Swift is by leveraging dependency injection. Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows for loosely coupled and easily testable code. By using this pattern, we can separate the responsibility of handling deep links from the rest of our app's architecture.

## 1. Define a DeepLinkHandler protocol

First, let's define a protocol called `DeepLinkHandler`. This protocol will have a single method `handleDeepLink(url: URL)` that will be implemented by the classes that handle specific deep link routes.

```swift
protocol DeepLinkHandler {
    func handleDeepLink(url: URL)
}
```

## 2. Implement DeepLinkHandlers for each route

Next, we'll create concrete classes that adopt the `DeepLinkHandler` protocol to handle specific deep link routes. For example, if our app has two deep link routes - `profile` and `settings`, we can create two separate handlers for each route.

```swift
class ProfileDeepLinkHandler: DeepLinkHandler {
    func handleDeepLink(url: URL) {
        // Handle profile deep link
        // Extract necessary parameters from the URL
        // Navigate to the profile screen
    }
}

class SettingsDeepLinkHandler: DeepLinkHandler {
    func handleDeepLink(url: URL) {
        // Handle settings deep link
        // Extract necessary parameters from the URL
        // Navigate to the settings screen
    }
}
```

## 3. Create a DeepLinkManager class

Now, let's create a `DeepLinkManager` class that will coordinate the handling of deep links. This class will have a dictionary that maps deep link routes to their respective `DeepLinkHandler` instances.

```swift
class DeepLinkManager {
    private var deepLinkHandlers: [String: DeepLinkHandler] = [
        "profile": ProfileDeepLinkHandler(),
        "settings": SettingsDeepLinkHandler()
    ]
    
    func handleDeepLink(url: URL) {
        guard let route = url.host else {
            return // Invalid deep link URL
        }
        
        guard let handler = deepLinkHandlers[route] else {
            return // Route not supported
        }
        
        handler.handleDeepLink(url: url)
    }
}
```

## 4. Inject the DeepLinkManager

To make use of the `DeepLinkManager` and handle deep links within our app's architecture, we need to inject it into the appropriate components. This can be done through dependency injection.

For example, if we have a `AppDelegate` that receives deep link URLs, we can inject the `DeepLinkManager` into it.

```swift
@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    var window: UIWindow?
    var deepLinkManager: DeepLinkManager?

    // ...

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey: Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
        deepLinkManager?.handleDeepLink(url: url)
        return true
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Conclusion

Using dependency injection to handle deep links in Swift can help keep our code modular, maintainable, and testable. By separating the responsibility of handling deep links into standalone classes, we can easily add new deep link routes and modify existing ones without impacting the rest of our app's architecture.
