In iOS development, barcode scanning is a common feature used in various applications. When implementing barcode scanning functionality in Swift, it's important to consider using dependency injection to improve modularity and testability of the code.

Dependency injection allows us to separate the code responsible for scanning barcodes from the code that consumes the scanned data. This separation makes it easier to manage dependencies and unit test the scanning functionality in isolation.

## 1. Define the Scanning Protocol

First, define a protocol that defines the behavior of the barcode scanning component. This protocol should include a method for starting the scanning process and a delegate method for handling scanned barcodes:

```swift
protocol BarcodeScanner {
    func startScanning()
    var delegate: BarcodeScannerDelegate? { get set }
}

protocol BarcodeScannerDelegate {
    func didScanBarcode(_ barcode: String)
}
```

## 2. Implement the Barcode Scanner

Next, implement a class that conforms to the `BarcodeScanner` protocol. This class will be responsible for managing the barcode scanning process using a native barcode scanning library or a custom implementation:

```swift
import AVFoundation

class AVFoundationBarcodeScanner: NSObject, BarcodeScanner, AVCaptureMetadataOutputObjectsDelegate {
    var delegate: BarcodeScannerDelegate?
  
    private var captureSession: AVCaptureSession?
    private var previewLayer: AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer?
  
    func startScanning() {
        guard let videoCaptureDevice = AVCaptureDevice.default(for: .video) else {
            print("Failed to get the camera device")
            return
        }
      
        guard let captureDeviceInput = try? AVCaptureDeviceInput(device: videoCaptureDevice) else {
            print("Failed to create input device with camera")
            return
        }
      
        captureSession = AVCaptureSession()
        captureSession?.addInput(captureDeviceInput)
      
        let metadataOutput = AVCaptureMetadataOutput()
        captureSession?.addOutput(metadataOutput)
      
        metadataOutput.setMetadataObjectsDelegate(self, queue: .main)
        metadataOutput.metadataObjectTypes = [.ean13, .ean8]
      
        previewLayer = AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer(session: captureSession!)
        previewLayer?.videoGravity = .resizeAspectFill
        previewLayer?.frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: UIScreen.main.bounds.width, height: UIScreen.main.bounds.height)
      
        // Display the camera preview layer
        // Add the preview layer to your desired view
      
        captureSession?.startRunning()
    }
  
    func metadataOutput(_ output: AVCaptureMetadataOutput, didOutput metadataObjects: [AVMetadataObject], from connection: AVCaptureConnection) {
        guard let metadataObj = metadataObjects.first as? AVMetadataMachineReadableCodeObject else {
            return
        }
      
        guard let barcode = metadataObj.stringValue else {
            return
        }
      
        delegate?.didScanBarcode(barcode)
        captureSession?.stopRunning()
        
        // Process the scanned barcode
    }
}
```

## 3. Implement Dependency Injection

Now, it's time to implement dependency injection for the barcode scanning functionality. We can achieve this by creating a separate class that handles the dependency injection. This class will be responsible for creating an instance of the barcode scanner and providing it to other components in the app:

```swift
```
class BarcodeScannerInjector {
    private init() {}

    static func provideBarcodeScanner() -> BarcodeScanner {
        return AVFoundationBarcodeScanner()
    }
}
```

With the `BarcodeScannerInjector` class in place, you can now inject the barcode scanner instance wherever it is needed in your app. This allows you to easily substitute different implementations of the `BarcodeScanner` protocol for mocking or replacing the native barcode scanner library, if needed.

## Conclusion

Implementing barcode scanning functionality in your iOS app can be made more modular and testable by utilizing dependency injection. By separating the code responsible for scanning barcodes into a separate class and injecting it where needed, you can enhance the modularity, maintainability, and testability of your Swift code.
