Handling device orientation changes is an important aspect of developing iOS applications. Whether you want to adjust the layout, update the UI, or perform certain actions based on the device orientation, having a robust mechanism in place is crucial.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use **dependency injection** to handle device orientation changes in Swift effectively.

## What is Dependency Injection?

**Dependency Injection** (DI) is a design pattern that enables us to decouple the dependencies of our components. It allows us to provide required dependencies to an object from the outside instead of instantiating them internally.

By adopting DI, we can improve modularity, testability, and maintainability of our codebase. It also helps in writing cleaner, loosely-coupled code that is easier to understand and maintain.

## Handling Device Orientation Changes

To handle device orientation changes in Swift using dependency injection, follow these steps:

1. Define a protocol (e.g., `OrientationHandler`) that declares the required methods for handling orientation changes.

2. Implement the protocol in a separate class (e.g., `OrientationHandlerImpl`) that will be responsible for the actual handling of orientation changes.

   ```swift
   protocol OrientationHandler {
       func handleOrientationChange(orientation: UIInterfaceOrientation)
   }

   class OrientationHandlerImpl: OrientationHandler {
       func handleOrientationChange(orientation: UIInterfaceOrientation) {
           // Handle the orientation change logic here
       }
   }
   ```

3. In your view controller, declare a property of type `OrientationHandler` and initialize it using dependency injection.

   ```swift
   class MyViewController: UIViewController {
       var orientationHandler: OrientationHandler?

       // Other code...

       override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
           super.viewWillAppear(animated)

           // Call the handleOrientationChange method
           orientationHandler?.handleOrientationChange(orientation: UIApplication.shared.statusBarOrientation)
       }

       // Other code...
   }
   ```

4. Before presenting or pushing the view controller, set the `orientationHandler` property with an instance of `OrientationHandlerImpl`.

   ```swift
   let myViewController = MyViewController()
   myViewController.orientationHandler = OrientationHandlerImpl()
   navigationController?.pushViewController(myViewController, animated: true)
   ```

By using dependency injection, we can easily provide a different implementation of the `OrientationHandler` protocol if needed. This approach makes it straightforward to test and swap out the orientation handling logic without modifying the view controller code.

## Conclusion

Dependency injection is a powerful technique that can greatly enhance the flexibility, testability, and maintainability of our codebase. By using it to handle device orientation changes in Swift, we can decouple the orientation handling logic from the view controller and ensure a more modular and reusable codebase.
