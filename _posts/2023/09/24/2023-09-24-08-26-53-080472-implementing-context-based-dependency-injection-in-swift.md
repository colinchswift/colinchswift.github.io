Context-based dependency injection is a design pattern that allows for more flexible dependency management in Swift applications. Instead of relying on a fixed dependency graph, dependencies are resolved based on the context or state of the application.

## Why Use Context-Based Dependency Injection?

Traditional dependency injection in Swift involves creating a dependency graph and injecting dependencies at the time of initialization. However, in some cases, the dependency graph can become complex and rigid, making it difficult to adapt to changing requirements.

With context-based dependency injection, dependencies are resolved based on the current context of the application. This allows for dynamic changes in the dependency graph and makes it easier to handle varying requirements or user interactions.

## Implementation Steps

To implement context-based dependency injection in Swift, follow these steps:

1. Define a protocol for the dependencies that your application requires. For example, create a protocol called `DependencyProtocol`.

```swift
protocol DependencyProtocol {
    // Define required methods and properties
}
```

2. Create different concrete implementations of the `DependencyProtocol` based on the application context or state. For example, you can create `DependencyImplementationA` and `DependencyImplementationB`:

```swift
class DependencyImplementationA: DependencyProtocol {
    // Implement methods and properties specific to context A
}

class DependencyImplementationB: DependencyProtocol {
    // Implement methods and properties specific to context B
}
```
   
3. Create a context manager that provides the appropriate dependency based on the current context. This manager should be responsible for resolving and providing the requested dependencies:

```swift
class DependencyManager {
    static let shared = DependencyManager()
    
    private init() {}
    
    private var currentContext: Context = .contextA
    
    func setContext(_ context: Context) {
        currentContext = context
    }
    
    func getDependency() -> DependencyProtocol {
        switch currentContext {
            case .contextA:
                return DependencyImplementationA()
            case .contextB:
                return DependencyImplementationB()
        }
    }
}

enum Context {
    case contextA
    case contextB
}
```

4. In your app, set the desired context using the `setContext` method of `DependencyManager`. Then, retrieve the appropriate dependency using the `getDependency` method:

```swift
DependencyManager.shared.setContext(.contextA)
let dependency = DependencyManager.shared.getDependency()

// Use the dependency in your app
```

## Conclusion

Context-based dependency injection provides a flexible approach to managing dependencies in Swift applications. By resolving dependencies based on the application's context or state, we can adapt to changing requirements and enable greater modularity and scalability. Consider using this design pattern to improve the flexibility of your Swift apps.
