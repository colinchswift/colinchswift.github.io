Dependency Injection is a design pattern that promotes loose coupling and modularity in software development. It allows for better testability, flexibility, and reusability of code. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement dependency injection for data persistence in Swift.

## What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection is a technique where the dependencies of a class are provided externally rather than creating them internally. This allows for decoupling the class from its dependencies, making it easier to test and swap out dependencies without modifying the class itself.

## Why Use Dependency Injection for Data Persistence?

In traditional data persistence implementations, the data layer is tightly coupled to the rest of the application. This makes it difficult to replace or test the data persistence layer without affecting the rest of the application. By using dependency injection, we can decouple the data persistence layer from the rest of the application, making it more modular and flexible.

## Example Scenario

Let's consider a simple scenario where we have a `UserRepository` class responsible for handling user data persistence. The `UserRepository` class has a dependency on a data storage mechanism, such as a database or a network service.

## Step 1: Define Protocols

To implement dependency injection, you'll need to define protocols that represent the dependencies your class requires.

```swift
protocol UserStorage {
    func save(user: User)
    func fetch() -> [User]
}

protocol UserRepository {
    func saveUser(user: User)
    func getUsers() -> [User]
}
```

Here, we define two protocols: `UserStorage` and `UserRepository`. The `UserRepository` protocol acts as a wrapper around the `UserStorage` protocol.

## Step 2: Implement the Data Storage

Next, we implement a class that conforms to the `UserStorage` protocol. This class will handle the actual data persistence.

```swift
class DatabaseUserStorage: UserStorage {
    func save(user: User) {
        // Implementation for saving user to a database
    }

    func fetch() -> [User] {
        // Implementation for fetching users from a database
        return []
    }
}
```

In this example, we implement a `DatabaseUserStorage` class that conforms to the `UserStorage` protocol. The functions `save(user:)` and `fetch()` implement the actual data persistence operations using a database.

## Step 3: Implement the Repository

Next, we implement a class that conforms to the `UserRepository` protocol. This class acts as a wrapper around the data storage mechanism.

```swift
class UserRepositoryImpl: UserRepository {
    private let userStorage: UserStorage

    init(userStorage: UserStorage) {
        self.userStorage = userStorage
    }

    func saveUser(user: User) {
        userStorage.save(user: user)
    }

    func getUsers() -> [User] {
        return userStorage.fetch()
    }
}
```

In this example, we implement a `UserRepositoryImpl` class that conforms to the `UserRepository` protocol. The `UserRepositoryImpl` class has a private property `userStorage` of type `UserStorage` which is injected through the initializer. The `saveUser(user:)` and `getUsers()` functions delegate the actual data persistence operations to the injected `userStorage` object.

## Step 4: Dependency Injection

Finally, we can use a dependency injection container or manually inject the dependencies to create and use the `UserRepository` instance.

```swift
let userStorage = DatabaseUserStorage()
let userRepository = UserRepositoryImpl(userStorage: userStorage)

// Usage
let user = User(name: "John")
userRepository.saveUser(user: user)

let users = userRepository.getUsers()
```

In this example, we create an instance of `DatabaseUserStorage` and pass it as a dependency to the `UserRepositoryImpl` initializer. This way, the `UserRepositoryImpl` class is decoupled from the specific data storage implementation.

## Conclusion

Implementing dependency injection for data persistence in Swift allows for more modular and flexible code. By separating the concerns of data persistence and business logic, we achieve better testability and maintainability. Using protocols and dependency injection, we can easily swap out the data storage mechanism or mock it for testing purposes.
