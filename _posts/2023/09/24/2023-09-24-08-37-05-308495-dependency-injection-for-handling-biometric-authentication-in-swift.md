Biometric authentication has become increasingly popular and widely adopted as a secure and convenient way to authenticate users in mobile applications. In this blog post, we will explore how to handle biometric authentication in Swift using dependency injection.

## What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that allows for the decoupling of components and their dependencies. It provides a way to pass dependencies to a class rather than having the class create or manage them themselves. This promotes flexibility, testability, and maintainability in your codebase.

## Why Use Dependency Injection for Biometric Authentication?

When it comes to handling biometric authentication in Swift, using dependency injection can offer several benefits:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Dependency injection helps to separate the authentication logic from the rest of the application, making it easier to test and maintain.

2. **Flexibility**: By injecting the authentication service, you can easily swap it with a different implementation, such as a mock service for testing purposes.

3. **Testability**: With dependency injection, you can easily replace the actual biometric authentication service with a mock implementation during unit testing.

## Implementing Dependency Injection for Biometric Authentication

To implement dependency injection for handling biometric authentication in Swift, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a BiometricAuthentication protocol

```swift
import LocalAuthentication

protocol BiometricAuthentication {
    func authenticateUser(completion: @escaping (Bool, Error?) -> Void)
}

class BiometricAuthenticationImpl: BiometricAuthentication {
    private let context = LAContext()

    func authenticateUser(completion: @escaping (Bool, Error?) -> Void) {
        var error: NSError?

        if context.canEvaluatePolicy(.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics, error: &error) {
            context.evaluatePolicy(.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics, localizedReason: "Authenticate to access the app") { success, evaluateError in
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    completion(success, evaluateError)
                }
            }
        } else {
            completion(false, error)
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Inject BiometricAuthentication into your ViewController

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    private let biometricAuthentication: BiometricAuthentication

    init(biometricAuthentication: BiometricAuthentication) {
        self.biometricAuthentication = biometricAuthentication
        super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
    }

    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {
        fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
    }

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        authenticateUser()
    }

    private func authenticateUser() {
        biometricAuthentication.authenticateUser { success, error in
            if success {
                // User successfully authenticated
                // Proceed with app flow
            } else {
                // Authentication failed
                // Show error message to the user
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Setup Dependency Injection

```swift
let biometricAuthentication = BiometricAuthenticationImpl()
let viewController = ViewController(biometricAuthentication: biometricAuthentication)
// Present viewController
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored the concept of dependency injection and how it can be applied to handle biometric authentication in Swift. By using dependency injection, we can separate concerns, improve flexibility, and enhance testability in our code. So go ahead and start implementing dependency injection in your biometric authentication workflows to make your code more modular and maintainable!
