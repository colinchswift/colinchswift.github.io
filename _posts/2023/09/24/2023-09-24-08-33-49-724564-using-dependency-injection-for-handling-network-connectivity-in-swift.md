In Swift, dependency injection is a powerful technique that allows us to decouple our code and make it more testable and maintainable. One common scenario where dependency injection can be useful is when handling network connectivity. In this blog post, we will explore how to use dependency injection to handle network connectivity in Swift.

## Why Use Dependency Injection?

Using dependency injection in network connectivity helps in isolating the networking code from the rest of the application. It provides flexibility and allows for easier unit testing by providing a way to inject mock dependencies during testing. Additionally, it makes the code more modular, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.

## Implementation

To implement dependency injection for handling network connectivity, we'll follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Protocol for Network Connectivity

First, we need to create a protocol that defines the methods for handling network connectivity. Let's call it `NetworkConnectivity`.

```swift
protocol NetworkConnectivity {
    func isConnected() -> Bool
}
```

### 2. Implement the Network Connectivity Protocol

Next, we'll create a class that conforms to the `NetworkConnectivity` protocol and implements the method `isConnected()`. This class will be responsible for checking the network connectivity using the appropriate APIs.

```swift
import Network

class NetworkConnectivityImpl: NetworkConnectivity {
    func isConnected() -> Bool {
        let monitor = NWPathMonitor()
        let semaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 0)

        var isConnected = false
        monitor.pathUpdateHandler = { path in
            isConnected = path.status == .satisfied
            semaphore.signal()
        }

        let queue = DispatchQueue(label: "NetworkConnectivityQueue")
        monitor.start(queue: queue)

        semaphore.wait()
        monitor.cancel()

        return isConnected
    }
}
```

In this example, we are using the `Network` framework introduced in iOS 12 to check the network connectivity.

### 3. Inject the Network Connectivity Dependency

Now, we'll inject the `NetworkConnectivity` dependency into the classes that need network connectivity checks. For example, let's consider a `DataManager` class that performs network operations:

```swift
class DataManager {
    private let networkConnectivity: NetworkConnectivity

    init(networkConnectivity: NetworkConnectivity) {
        self.networkConnectivity = networkConnectivity
    }

    func fetchData() {
        if networkConnectivity.isConnected() {
            // Perform network operation
        } else {
            // Show error message or perform offline handling
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Usage

Finally, when creating an instance of `DataManager`, inject the `NetworkConnectivity` implementation that suits your needs. During testing, you can easily inject a mock implementation of `NetworkConnectivity` to simulate different network conditions.

```swift
let networkConnectivity = NetworkConnectivityImpl()
let dataManager = DataManager(networkConnectivity: networkConnectivity)
dataManager.fetchData()
```

## Conclusion

Using dependency injection for handling network connectivity in Swift can greatly improve the flexibility, testability, and maintainability of your code. By separating the network connectivity logic into its own class with a defined protocol, you can easily swap out different implementations and provide custom behavior during testing. Consider applying this technique in your projects to make your networking code more modular and robust.
