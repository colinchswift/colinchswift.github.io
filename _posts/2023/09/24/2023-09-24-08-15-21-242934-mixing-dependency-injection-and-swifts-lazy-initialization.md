In object-oriented programming, dependency injection (DI) is a technique that allows objects to be loosely coupled by injecting their dependencies instead of creating them internally. On the other hand, Swift provides a powerful lazy initialization feature that delays the creation of an object until it is actually needed. But what happens when you want to combine the benefits of both?

## The Problem

Let's say we have a class `Logger` that needs an instance of `NetworkManager` to make network requests. Traditionally, we would create the `NetworkManager` internally within the `Logger` class. However, we want to take advantage of DI to make `Logger` more flexible and testable.

## Using Dependency Injection

To use dependency injection, we need to modify the `Logger` class to accept an instance of `NetworkManager` in its initializer.

```swift
class Logger {
    private let networkManager: NetworkManager

    init(networkManager: NetworkManager) {
        self.networkManager = networkManager
    }

    // Logger functionality here...
}
```

This change allows us to inject any implementation of `NetworkManager` when creating a `Logger` instance, improving flexibility and enabling easier testing.

## Delaying Initialization with Lazy Initialization

Now, let's bring in Swift's lazy initialization feature to avoid creating the `NetworkManager` until we actually need it. We can achieve this by making the `networkManager` property lazy.

```swift
class Logger {
    private lazy var networkManager: NetworkManager = {
        return NetworkManager()
    }()

    // Rest of the Logger class...
}
```

With this modification, the `networkManager` property will only be created when it is accessed for the first time. Until then, it remains uninitialized.

## Mixing Dependency Injection and Lazy Initialization

To combine both DI and lazy initialization, we can modify the `Logger` class to accept an optional `NetworkManager` instance in its initializer. If it is provided, we use it directly. Otherwise, we fall back to lazy initialization.

```swift
class Logger {
    private lazy var networkManager: NetworkManager = {
        return NetworkManager()
    }()

    init(networkManager: NetworkManager? = nil) {
        if let networkManager = networkManager {
            self.networkManager = networkManager
        }
    }

    // Logger functionality here...
}
```

With this approach, we can choose to inject a specific `NetworkManager` instance if needed, or let the logger create one lazily when necessary.

## Conclusion

By combining dependency injection and Swift's lazy initialization, we can achieve a more flexible and efficient design. Dependency injection allows for loose coupling and testability, while lazy initialization delays object creation until it is required, reducing unnecessary resource allocation.
