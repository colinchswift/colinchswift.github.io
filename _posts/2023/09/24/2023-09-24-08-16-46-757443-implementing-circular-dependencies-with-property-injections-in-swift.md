Circular dependencies occur when two or more objects depend on each other. In Swift, circular dependencies can be challenging to handle, but property injections offer a solution. Property injections allow us to break the dependency cycle by injecting dependencies as properties rather than initializing them during object creation.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement circular dependencies using property injections in Swift. Specifically, we will demonstrate this with an example involving two classes: `ClassA` and `ClassB`. 

## The Problem

Consider the following scenario: `ClassA` depends on `ClassB`, and `ClassB` depends on `ClassA`. This creates a circular dependency that cannot be resolved through traditional initialization. When we try to create an instance of `ClassA` and `ClassB`, we encounter a compile-time error due to the circular dependency.

## Property Injection

Property injection is a technique that enables us to resolve dependencies dynamically. Instead of initializing the dependencies during object creation, we declare the dependencies as properties and set them later.

Let's see how we can implement property injection to resolve our circular dependency issue.

## Implementation

We'll start by defining `ClassA` and `ClassB` with their respective properties:

```swift
class ClassA {
    var classB: ClassB!
}

class ClassB {
    var classA: ClassA!
}
```

Notice that we are using implicitly unwrapped optional (`!`) to declare the properties. This means they will be automatically unwrapped when accessed, allowing us to set them later.

Next, we create instances of `ClassA` and `ClassB`, and inject their dependencies:

```swift
let instanceA = ClassA()
let instanceB = ClassB()

instanceA.classB = instanceB
instanceB.classA = instanceA
```

By setting `instanceB` to the `classB` property of `instanceA`, and `instanceA` to the `classA` property of `instanceB`, we successfully resolve the circular dependency.

## Conclusion

Circular dependencies can be challenging to manage, but property injections offer an elegant solution. By declaring dependencies as properties and setting them dynamically, we can break the dependency cycle and resolve circular dependencies in Swift.

Remember to use property injections sparingly, as they can make code harder to understand and maintain if used excessively. However, when encountering circular dependencies, property injections provide a practical approach for resolving the issue.
