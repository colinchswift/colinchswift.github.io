Dependency injection is a powerful design pattern that allows for better separation of concerns and improves the testability and maintainability of code. In Swift, dependency injection can be achieved using protocols and classes. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement scoped dependency injection in Swift.

## Why Scoped Dependency Injection?

Scoped dependency injection allows for controlling the lifetime of dependencies and provides different instances of dependencies based on a predefined scope. This is useful in scenarios where you need different instances of a dependency within specific scopes or contexts, such as within a single user session or request.

## Implementing Scoped Dependency Injection

To implement scoped dependency injection in Swift, we will use a combination of protocols, classes, and a dependency container. 

Let's start by defining a protocol for our dependencies:

```swift
protocol UserManagerProtocol {
    func login(username: String, password: String)
    func logout()
}
```

Next, we create a class that conforms to this protocol:

```swift
class UserManager: UserManagerProtocol {
    func login(username: String, password: String) {
        // Implementation for login
    }

    func logout() {
        // Implementation for logout
    }
}
```

Now, let's create a dependency container class that will handle the creation and scoping of our dependencies:

```swift
class DependencyContainer {
    private var cachedUserManager: UserManagerProtocol?

    func getUserManager() -> UserManagerProtocol {
        if let userManager = cachedUserManager {
            return userManager
        } else {
            let userManager = UserManager()
            cachedUserManager = userManager
            return userManager
        }
    }
}
```

In the example above, we create a private property `cachedUserManager` to store the instance of the `UserManager` class. The `getUserManager()` function returns the `UserManager` instance, creating it if it doesn't exist or returning the cached instance if it does.

To use the scoped dependency injection, we can instantiate the `DependencyContainer`, request the `UserManager` instance, and use it within a specific scope:

```swift
let container = DependencyContainer()
let userManager = container.getUserManager()

userManager.login(username: "example", password: "password")
// Perform other operations with the userManager

userManager.logout()
```

By using this approach, we can control the lifetime and scope of our dependencies, ensuring that we get the correct instances within the desired context.

## Conclusion

Scoped dependency injection is a powerful technique in Swift that allows for better control over the lifetime and scope of dependencies. By implementing a dependency container and defining protocols for dependencies, we can achieve cleaner and more modular code, improving testability and maintainability.
