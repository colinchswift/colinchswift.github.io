Push notifications are a powerful tool to engage and retain users in mobile applications. To implement push notifications in an iOS app using Swift, we can leverage the power of reactive programming. Reactive programming allows us to handle asynchronous events in a more elegant and concise way, making our code more maintainable and scalable.

## Setting up Push Notifications

Before we dive into reactive programming, let's first set up push notifications in our iOS app.

1. Enable push notifications in your app's capabilities settings in Xcode.

2. Register for push notifications in your app's `AppDelegate`:

```swift
import UIKit
import UserNotifications

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate, UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate {

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self
        UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: [.alert, .badge, .sound]) { (granted, error) in
            if granted {
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    application.registerForRemoteNotifications()
                }
            }
        }
        return true
    }
    
    // Handle device token registration
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
        let token = deviceToken.map { String(format: "%02.2hhx", $0) }.joined()
        print("Device Token:", token)
    }
    
    // Handle push notification reception
    func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter, didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse, withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void) {
        // Handle notification action here
        completionHandler()
    }    
}
```

3. Now, when a user allows push notifications and the app is registered successfully, the device token will be printed in the console.

## Reactive Programming with RxSwift

Now that we have set up push notifications in our app, let's integrate reactive programming using RxSwift to handle push notification events in a more reactive way. 

First, let's install the `RxSwift` and `RxCocoa` libraries. You can do this using Cocoapods or the Swift Package Manager.

1. Create a new Swift file called `PushNotificationManager.swift` and import the necessary frameworks:

```swift
import Foundation
import RxSwift
import RxCocoa
import UserNotifications
```

2. Create a singleton class `PushNotificationManager` to handle push notifications:

```swift
class PushNotificationManager: NSObject {
    
    static let shared = PushNotificationManager()
    
    private let disposeBag = DisposeBag()
    
    // Subject to emit push notification received events
    private let pushNotificationSubject = PublishSubject<UNNotification>()
    
    // Observable for push notification received events
    var pushNotifications: Observable<UNNotification> {
        return pushNotificationSubject.asObserver()
    }
    
    // Private initializer to prevent instantiation
    private override init() {
        super.init()
        UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self
    }
}

// MARK: UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate
extension PushNotificationManager: UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate {
    
    func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter, didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse, withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void) {
        pushNotificationSubject.onNext(response.notification)
        completionHandler()
    }
}
```

3. Now, we can observe push notification events in any part of our app by subscribing to the `pushNotifications` observable:

```swift
PushNotificationManager.shared.pushNotifications
    .subscribe(onNext: { notification in
        // Handle push notification received event
    }).disposed(by: disposeBag)
```

## Conclusion

By combining push notifications with reactive programming using Swift and RxSwift, we can handle push notification events in a more elegant and reactive way. Using the power of reactive programming allows us to easily observe and react to push notification events, making our code more maintainable and scalable.
