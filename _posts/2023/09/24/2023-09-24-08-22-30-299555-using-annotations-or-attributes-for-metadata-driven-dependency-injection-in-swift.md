Dependency injection is a powerful technique in software development that allows for modular and testable code. In Swift, one approach to achieve dependency injection is through the use of annotations or attributes. By adding metadata to your code, you can provide additional information about the dependencies required by your classes or functions.

Let's explore how we can use annotations to enable metadata-driven dependency injection in Swift.

## Step 1: Define Dependencies

The first step is to define the dependencies that your code requires. For instance, let's say we have a `UserService` that requires a `UserRepository` to fetch and save user data. We can define these dependencies as protocols:

```swift
protocol UserRepository {
    // ...
}

protocol UserService {
    var userRepository: UserRepository { get }
    
    // ...
}
```

## Step 2: Create Annotations

In Swift, annotations can be created using custom attributes. We can define an annotation called `@Inject` that associates a property or parameter with its corresponding dependency. Here's an example:

```swift
@attribute
class Inject {
    let key: String
    
    init(_ key: String) {
        self.key = key
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Apply Annotations

Now, we can apply the `@Inject` annotation to the properties that require injection. For example, in our `UserService` implementation, we can annotate the `userRepository` property:

```swift
class UserServiceImpl: UserService {
    @Inject("userRepo") var userRepository: UserRepository
    
    // ...
}
```

## Step 4: Building the Container

To complete the metadata-driven dependency injection, we need to create a container that maps the dependencies to their implementations. This container can be a simple dictionary:

```swift
class DIContainer {
    private var dependencies: [String: Any] = [:]
    
    func register<T>(_ dependency: T, forKey key: String) {
        dependencies[key] = dependency
    }
    
    func resolve<T>(forKey key: String) -> T? {
        return dependencies[key] as? T
    }
}
```

## Step 5: Resolving Dependencies

Finally, we can use the `DIContainer` to resolve and inject the dependencies. Here's an example:

```swift
let container = DIContainer()

container.register(UserRepositoryImpl(), forKey: "userRepo")
container.register(UserServiceImpl(), forKey: "userService")

let userService: UserService? = container.resolve(forKey: "userService")
```

By retrieving the `userService` from the container, the `userRepository` property will be automatically injected based on the annotation and the key provided.

## Conclusion

Using annotations or attributes for metadata-driven dependency injection in Swift can greatly improve the modularity and testability of your code. By adding metadata to your classes and properties, you can achieve cleaner and more maintainable dependencies. Consider using this technique in your Swift projects to promote better code organization and flexibility.
