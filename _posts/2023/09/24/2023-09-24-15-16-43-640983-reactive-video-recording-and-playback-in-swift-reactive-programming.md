Reactively handling video recording and playback in your Swift projects can greatly enhance the user experience and make your app more responsive. In this blog post, we will explore how to achieve this using reactive programming techniques. So let's get started!

## What is Reactive Programming?

Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on asynchronous data streams and propagates changes to those streams throughout the application. It allows developers to build responsive, event-driven systems by utilizing observable sequences and functional reactive operators.

## Recording a Video

To record a video reactively in Swift, we can use the AVFoundation framework which provides a high-level interface for working with multimedia. First, we need to import the AVFoundation module into our project:

```swift
import AVFoundation
```

Next, let's create an instance of `AVCaptureSession`, which represents the configuration of the receiving and recording of data:

```swift
let session = AVCaptureSession()
```

To start recording a video, we need to set up an instance of `AVCaptureMovieFileOutput` and add it to our session:

```swift
let output = AVCaptureMovieFileOutput()
session.addOutput(output)
```

To initiate the recording, we can call the `startRecording(to:completionHandler:)` method on the `AVCaptureMovieFileOutput` instance:

```swift
output.startRecording(to: outputFileURL, completionHandler: nil)
```

Here, `outputFileURL` represents the URL where the recorded video will be saved. We can reactively handle the completion of the recording by observing changes to the `isRecording` property of the `AVCaptureMovieFileOutput`:

```swift
output.rx.observe(Bool.self, "isRecording")
    .skip(1) // Skip initial value change
    .subscribe(onNext: { isRecording in
        if isRecording == false {
            // Recording completed
        }
    })
    .disposed(by: disposeBag)
```

## Playing Back a Recorded Video

To play back a recorded video reactively, we can utilize the AVPlayer framework. First, let's import the AVFoundation module into our project:

```swift
import AVFoundation
import AVKit
```

Next, create an instance of `AVPlayer` and set its player item to an `AVPlayerItem` instance constructed with the URL of the recorded video:

```swift
let player = AVPlayer()
let playerItem = AVPlayerItem(url: videoURL)
player.replaceCurrentItem(with: playerItem)
```

To play the video, we can create an instance of `AVPlayerViewController` and set its player property to our `AVPlayer` instance:

```swift
let playerViewController = AVPlayerViewController()
playerViewController.player = player
```

Finally, we can present the `AVPlayerViewController`:

```swift
present(playerViewController, animated: true) {
    self.playerViewController.player?.play()
}
```

We can utilize reactive programming to handle various playback events. For example, to observe the playback status, we can use the `rx.status` property of `AVPlayer`:

```swift
player.rx.status
    .subscribe(onNext: { status in
        if status == .readyToPlay {
            // Player is ready to play
        }
    })
    .disposed(by: disposeBag)
```

## Conclusion

By embracing reactive programming principles, we can create a more efficient and responsive video recording and playback experience in our Swift projects. The AVFoundation and AVPlayer frameworks provide powerful tools for handling multimedia tasks, and reactive programming allows us to elegantly manage the flow of data and events. So go ahead and start incorporating reactive techniques into your video-related features today!
