When working with JSON data in Swift, it's common to encounter scenarios where objects have circular references, meaning that an object refers to another object, which in turn refers back to the original object. This can lead to infinite loops during JSON encoding and decoding, causing crashes or incorrect data representation. In this blog post, we will explore different approaches to handle circular references in Swift.

## Understanding the Problem

Circular references occur when two or more objects hold references to each other. For example, let's consider a `Person` class with a reference to a `Pet` object, and the `Pet` object has a reference back to its owner `Person`. If we try to encode this structure into JSON, the JSON encoder will not be able to break the circular reference and run into an infinite loop.

## Approach 1: Ignoring Circular References

Swift's `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` classes provide a way to ignore circular references by using the `JSONEncoder.KeyEncodingStrategy` and `JSONDecoder.KeyDecodingStrategy` properties, respectively. By setting these properties to `.convertToSnakeCase`, we can instruct the encoder/decoder to ignore circular references and continue with the encoding/decoding process.

```swift
struct Person: Codable {
    let name: String
    let pet: Pet
    
    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case name
        case pet = "my_pet"
    }
}

struct Pet: Codable {
    let name: String
    weak var owner: Person?
}

let encoder = JSONEncoder()
encoder.keyEncodingStrategy = .convertToSnakeCase

let person = Person(name: "John Doe", pet: Pet(name: "Max"))
let jsonData = try encoder.encode(person)

let decoder = JSONDecoder()
decoder.keyDecodingStrategy = .convertFromSnakeCase

let decodedPerson = try decoder.decode(Person.self, from: jsonData)
```

In this approach, we use the `weak` keyword to declare the reference to the owner `Person` in the `Pet` struct. This tells Swift that the reference is weak, allowing it to break the circular reference during encoding and decoding.

## Approach 2: Custom Coding Implementation

Alternatively, we can implement custom coding methods in our custom classes to handle circular references explicitly. By overriding the `encode(to:)` and `init(from:)` methods from the `Encodable` and `Decodable` protocols, we can manually manage the encoding and decoding process, breaking the circular references manually.

```swift
class Person: Codable {
    let name: String
    let pet: Pet
    
    init(name: String, pet: Pet) {
        self.name = name
        self.pet = pet
        pet.owner = self
    }
    
    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case name
        case pet
    }
    
    func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
        var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        try container.encode(name, forKey: .name)
        try container.encode(pet, forKey: .pet)
    }
    
    required init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        name = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .name)
        pet = try container.decode(Pet.self, forKey: .pet)
        pet.owner = self
    }
}

class Pet: Codable {
    let name: String
    weak var owner: Person?
    
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
    
    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case name
    }
    
    func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
        var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        try container.encode(name, forKey: .name)
    }
    
    required init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        name = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .name)
    }
}

let encoder = JSONEncoder()
let person = Person(name: "John Doe", pet: Pet(name: "Max"))
let jsonData = try encoder.encode(person)

let decoder = JSONDecoder()
let decodedPerson = try decoder.decode(Person.self, from: jsonData)
```

In this approach, we explicitly encode and decode the properties of `Person` and `Pet` classes, breaking the circular references. We also update the `owner` property in the `Pet` class during the decoding process to establish the circular relationship.

## Conclusion

Circular references can be a challenging problem when working with JSON encoding and decoding in Swift. By either ignoring circular references using the built-in options or implementing custom coding methods, we can successfully handle circular references and prevent crashes or incorrect data representation. Choose the approach that best suits your use case and ensure your JSON data is accurately encoded and decoded.
