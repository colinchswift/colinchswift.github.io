In Swift, you often need to convert data structures, such as structs, into JSON strings for transmitting or storing data in JSON format. Converting Swift structs to JSON strings can be achieved using the `JSONEncoder` class provided by the `Foundation` framework. 

Here's an example of how to convert a Swift struct to a JSON string:

```swift
import Foundation

struct Person: Codable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
    let email: String
}

let person = Person(name: "John Doe", age: 25, email: "johndoe@example.com")

let encoder = JSONEncoder()
encoder.outputFormatting = .prettyPrinted

do {
    let jsonData = try encoder.encode(person)
    let jsonString = String(data: jsonData, encoding: .utf8)

    print(jsonString ?? "")
} catch {
    print("Error encoding struct to JSON: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

In the above example, we define a `Person` struct with three properties: `name`, `age`, and `email`. The struct conforms to the `Codable` protocol, which enables easy encoding and decoding between JSON and Swift types.

We create an instance of `Person` and set its properties. Then, we create an instance of `JSONEncoder`, which is responsible for converting Swift types to JSON data. By setting `outputFormatting` property to `.prettyPrinted`, the resulting JSON string will be indented for better readability.

We enclose the encoding process within a `do-catch` block to handle any potential errors. Inside the `do` block, we encode the `person` struct using `encoder.encode(_:)` method and obtain the resulting JSON data.

Finally, we convert the JSON data to a string using `String(data:encoding:)` initializer with the `.utf8` encoding. Upon successful conversion, we print the JSON string.

Remember to import the `Foundation` framework at the beginning of your code file to access the required classes for JSON encoding.

That's it! You have now successfully converted a Swift struct to a JSON string using `JSONEncoder`. Enjoy encoding to JSON in your Swift projects!
