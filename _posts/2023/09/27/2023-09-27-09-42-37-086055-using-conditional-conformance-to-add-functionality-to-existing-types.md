Conditional conformance in Swift enables us to extend existing types by adding additional functionality based on specific conditions. It allows us to write clearer and more concise code by specializing methods, properties, and protocols for specific scenarios.

In this blog post, we will explore how conditional conformance works and how it can be used to enhance existing types in Swift.

## Understanding Conditional Conformance

Conditional conformance is all about providing specialized implementations for a generic type only under certain conditions. For example, let's say we have a generic type called `Container`:

```swift
struct Container<T> {
    var items: [T]
}
```

By default, the `Container` type is not equatable, meaning we cannot compare two instances of `Container` for equality using the `==` operator. However, we can add conditional conformance to make it equatable only when the type `T` is also equatable.

```swift
extension Container: Equatable where T: Equatable {
    static func == (lhs: Container, rhs: Container) -> Bool {
        return lhs.items == rhs.items
    }
}
```
In the above code, we extend the `Container` type and add conformance to the `Equatable` protocol, but only when the type `T` conforms to `Equatable`. This ensures that we can compare `Container` instances only when the underlying type is equatable.

## Adding Functionality with Conditional Conformance

Conditional conformance is especially useful when we want to add specific functionality to existing types based on certain conditions. Let's take a look at an example.

```swift
protocol CodableContainer {
    associatedtype ItemType: Codable

    var items: [ItemType] { get set }
    func encode() throws -> Data
}

extension CodableContainer where Self: Encodable {
    func encode() throws -> Data {
        return try JSONEncoder().encode(self)
    }
}
```

In the above code, we define a protocol called `CodableContainer`. It requires a type conforming to `Codable` and provides a method `encode()` to encode the container into `Data`. We then extend the protocol and provide a default implementation of `encode()` using `JSONEncoder` when the conforming type itself is `Encodable`. This means that only `Codable` types that also conform to `Encodable` will get this default implementation.

## Conclusion

Conditional conformance allows us to add specialized functionality to existing types based on specific conditions. It helps to keep our code clean and concise by avoiding unnecessary conformance for types that don't need it.

By understanding and leveraging conditional conformance, we can enhance the behavior of generic types in Swift and make our code more expressive and maintainable.
