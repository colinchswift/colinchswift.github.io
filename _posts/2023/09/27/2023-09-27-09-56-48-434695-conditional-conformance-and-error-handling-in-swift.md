Swift is a powerful and flexible programming language, and one of its notable features is conditional conformance. Conditional conformance allows you to extend types conditionally to satisfy certain requirements based on a specific condition. This feature is particularly useful when you want to add functionality to existing types only under certain circumstances.

Conditional conformance is achieved by using the `where` clause in Swift. Let's take a look at an example to understand how it works:

```swift
protocol Numeric {
    static func +(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Self
    static func *(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Self
}

extension Int: Numeric {}
extension Double: Numeric {}

func sum<T: Numeric>(numbers: [T]) -> T where T: ExpressibleByIntegerLiteral {
    var result: T = 0
    for number in numbers {
        result += number
    }
    return result
}

let integers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let doubleNumbers = [1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5]

let intSum = sum(numbers: integers) // 15
let doubleSum = sum(numbers: doubleNumbers) // 17.5
```

In the above example, we define a `Numeric` protocol that requires conforming types to implement the addition and multiplication operators. We then extend `Int` and `Double` to conform to this protocol.

Next, we define a generic function `sum` that takes an array of numbers of any type conforming to `Numeric`. However, we restrict the generic type `T` to only accept types that can be initialized from an integer literal. We achieve this using the `where` clause. This ensures that the function can only be used with types that can be added like integers.

Finally, we test our `sum` function by passing arrays of integers and double values. As a result, the function provides the sum of the numbers. The conditional conformance using the `where` clause allows the function to be more specific about the types it can operate on.

Conditional conformance is a powerful feature that allows you to write more generic and flexible code in Swift. It enables you to extend types based on specific conditions, making your code more expressive and reusable.

# Error Handling in Swift

Error handling is an essential part of building robust applications. In Swift, error handling is done using the `try`, `catch`, and `throw` keywords. The `try` keyword is used to indicate that a particular line of code can potentially throw an error. The `catch` block is used to handle and react to the thrown error, and the `throw` keyword is used to explicitly throw an error.

Here's an example that demonstrates error handling in Swift:

```swift
enum DivisionError: Error {
    case divisionByZero
}

func divide(_ dividend: Int, by divisor: Int) throws -> Int {
    guard divisor != 0 else {
        throw DivisionError.divisionByZero
    }
    return dividend / divisor
}

do {
    let result = try divide(10, by: 0)
    print("Division result: \(result)")
} catch DivisionError.divisionByZero {
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
} catch {
    print("An error occurred: \(error)")
}
```

In the above example, we define a custom `DivisionError` enum that conforms to the `Error` protocol, representing a division by zero error. We then define a function `divide` that takes two integers, `dividend` and `divisor`, and attempts to perform the division. If the divisor is zero, the function throws a `DivisionError.divisionByZero` error.

To handle the potential error, we use the `do` and `catch` blocks. Inside the `do` block, we call the `divide` function using the `try` keyword to indicate that it can throw an error. Inside the `catch` blocks, we handle specific errors by matching against the corresponding enum cases. In the catch-all `catch` block, we handle any other errors that may occur.

In this case, since the divisor is zero, the `divide` function throws a `DivisionError.divisionByZero` error. The `catch` block for this specific error is executed, and the corresponding message is printed. If there were other potential errors, we could handle each of them in separate `catch` blocks.

Error handling in Swift allows you to gracefully handle exceptional circumstances and failures in your code. It provides a structured way to handle errors and recover from them, improving the reliability and stability of your applications.
