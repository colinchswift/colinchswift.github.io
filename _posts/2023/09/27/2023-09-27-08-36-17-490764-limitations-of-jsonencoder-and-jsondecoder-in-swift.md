JSON is a popular data format used for transmitting and storing structured data. In Swift, the `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` classes provide a convenient way to encode Swift types to JSON and decode JSON data into Swift types, respectively. While these classes offer powerful functionality, it's important to understand their limitations. In this article, we'll explore some common limitations of `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` in Swift.

## 1. Lack of Support for Circular References

A circular reference occurs when an object refers back to itself in a way that creates an infinite loop. The `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` classes are not able to handle objects that have circular references. When attempting to encode or decode an object with a circular reference, these classes will throw an error.

To work around this limitation, you can manually implement encoding and decoding methods for objects with circular references. This typically involves breaking the circular reference by omitting certain properties during encoding and recreating them during decoding.

## 2. Limited Customization Options

While `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` provide sensible default behaviors, they have limited customization options. For example, it can be challenging to customize the key encoding strategy, especially if you want to deviate from the default `camelCase` style. Similarly, there are limitations when it comes to customizing the decoding process, such as handling different date formats or transforming data during decoding.

To overcome these limitations, you can consider creating your own encoding and decoding strategies by implementing the `CodingKey` protocol for key customization or creating custom coding keys. Additionally, you can implement your own `init(from decoder: Decoder)` method to handle custom decoding logic.

## Final Thoughts

While `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` provide a convenient way to work with JSON data in Swift, it's important to be aware of their limitations. Understanding these limitations allows you to anticipate potential issues when encoding and decoding Swift types to and from JSON. By implementing workarounds and customizations, you can overcome these limitations and work more effectively with JSON in your Swift applications.
