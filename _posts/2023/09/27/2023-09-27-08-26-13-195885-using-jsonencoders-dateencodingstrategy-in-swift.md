When working with JSON data in Swift, it's common to encounter the need to encode and decode `Date` objects. JSONEncoder provides a `dateEncodingStrategy` property that allows you to specify how dates should be encoded into JSON strings.

## Basic Usage

To get started, let's assume we have a `User` struct that contains a `name` and a `birthday` property:

```swift
struct User: Codable {
    let name: String
    let birthday: Date
}
```

To encode a `User` object into JSON, we can use an instance of `JSONEncoder` with a specified `dateEncodingStrategy`. Here's an example:

```swift
let user = User(name: "John Doe", birthday: Date())

let encoder = JSONEncoder()
encoder.dateEncodingStrategy = .iso8601

do {
    let jsonData = try encoder.encode(user)
    
    if let jsonString = String(data: jsonData, encoding: .utf8) {
        print(jsonString)
    }
} catch {
    print("Error encoding user: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

In this example, we set the `dateEncodingStrategy` property to `.iso8601`, which encodes dates in ISO 8601 format. This is a common format used for representing dates in JSON. The resulting JSON string will look something like this:

```json
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "birthday": "2021-06-10T12:34:56Z"
}
```

## Available Date Encoding Strategies

The `JSONEncoder.DateEncodingStrategy` enum provides various options for encoding dates. Here are some of the most commonly used strategies:

- `.deferredToDate`: Encodes the date as a `Double` value representing the number of seconds since the Unix epoch.
- `.secondsSince1970`: Encodes the date as a `Double` value representing the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.
- `.millisecondsSince1970`: Encodes the date as a `Double` value representing the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970.
- `.iso8601`: Encodes the date in ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2021-06-10T12:34:56Z").
- `.formatted`: Encodes the date using a custom date formatter.

You can choose the most suitable strategy for your specific use case.

## Conclusion

The `dateEncodingStrategy` property of `JSONEncoder` provides a flexible way to encode `Date` objects into JSON strings. By specifying the appropriate encoding strategy, you can ensure that dates are represented in a format that is compatible with your API or data model.
