One of the powerful features of Swift is its support for protocols and protocol hierarchies. A protocol hierarchy allows the definition of a more general protocol that inherits from one or more other protocols. Conforming to a protocol hierarchy means that a type must conform to all the protocols in the hierarchy.

In Swift, conditional conformances enable us to conditionally conform a type to a protocol based on certain conditions. This feature is particularly useful when working with protocol hierarchies. It allows us to automatically provide protocol conformance for types that already conform to parent protocols in the hierarchy.

Let's illustrate this concept with an example. Suppose we have a protocol hierarchy where `ParentProtocol` is the parent protocol and `ChildProtocol` inherits from `ParentProtocol`. We want to conditionally conform a type, say `MyType`, to `ChildProtocol` if it already conforms to `ParentProtocol`.

```swift
protocol ParentProtocol {
    func parentMethod()
}

protocol ChildProtocol: ParentProtocol {
    func childMethod()
}

struct MyType {

}

extension MyType: ParentProtocol {
    func parentMethod() {
        print("Implementing parent method")
    }
}

extension MyType: ChildProtocol where MyType: ParentProtocol {
    func childMethod() {
        print("Implementing child method")
    }
}
```

In the example above, we define the protocols `ParentProtocol` and `ChildProtocol`, where `ChildProtocol` inherits from `ParentProtocol`. Then, we define the `MyType` struct. We extend `MyType` to conform to `ParentProtocol` and implement the `parentMethod()`.

We use a conditional conformance extension to conform `MyType` to `ChildProtocol` by adding a constraint that `MyType` should already conform to `ParentProtocol`. In this case, we implement the `childMethod()`.

By using conditional conformance, if `MyType` already conforms to `ParentProtocol`, it will be automatically extended to conform to `ChildProtocol` as well.

Conditional conformance for protocol hierarchies is a powerful feature in Swift that allows for more flexible and expressive code. It helps us leverage protocol hierarchies by automatically providing protocol conformance for types that already conform to parent protocols.
