When working with server-side frameworks in Swift, it is common to exchange data in JSON format between the server and the client. Swift provides two powerful classes, `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder`, that simplify the process of encoding Swift types to JSON and decoding JSON to Swift types. In this article, we will explore how to integrate these classes into server-side frameworks.

## JSONEncoder

`JSONEncoder` is a class provided by Swift's `Foundation` framework that enables encoding Swift types to JSON. It conforms to the `Encoder` protocol and provides methods and properties to customize the encoding process.

To integrate `JSONEncoder` into a server-side framework, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Import the Foundation framework
```swift
import Foundation
```

### Step 2: Create an instance of JSONEncoder
```swift
let encoder = JSONEncoder()
```

### Step 3: Set encoding strategies (optional)
You can customize the encoding process by setting various strategies on the encoder. For example, if you want to convert Swift property names to snake case in the JSON output, you can set the `keyEncodingStrategy` property to `.convertToSnakeCase`:
```swift
encoder.keyEncodingStrategy = .convertToSnakeCase
```

### Step 4: Encode a Swift type to JSON
```swift
do {
    let jsonData = try encoder.encode(yourSwiftType)
    let jsonString = String(data: jsonData, encoding: .utf8)
} catch {
    print("Error encoding: \(error)")
}
```

## JSONDecoder

`JSONDecoder` is another class provided by Swift's `Foundation` framework that enables decoding JSON into Swift types. It conforms to the `Decoder` protocol and provides methods and properties to customize the decoding process.

To integrate `JSONDecoder` into a server-side framework, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Import the Foundation framework
```swift
import Foundation
```

### Step 2: Create an instance of JSONDecoder
```swift
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
```

### Step 3: Set decoding strategies (optional)
You can customize the decoding process by setting various strategies on the decoder. For example, if you want to convert snake case JSON keys to Swift property names, you can set the `keyDecodingStrategy` property to `.convertFromSnakeCase`:
```swift
decoder.keyDecodingStrategy = .convertFromSnakeCase
```

### Step 4: Decode JSON into a Swift type
```swift
do {
    let yourSwiftType = try decoder.decode(YourSwiftType.self, from: jsonData)
} catch {
    print("Error decoding: \(error)")
}
```

## Conclusion

By integrating `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` into server-side frameworks, you can easily serialize Swift types to JSON and deserialize JSON into Swift types. This allows for seamless data exchange between the server and the client. So go ahead and leverage these powerful classes in your Swift server-side projects, and take advantage of the simplicity and flexibility they provide!
