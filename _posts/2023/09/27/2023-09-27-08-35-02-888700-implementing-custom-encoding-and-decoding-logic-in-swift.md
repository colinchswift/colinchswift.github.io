With Swift, you have the flexibility to create your own custom encoding and decoding logic for data conversion. This can be useful when you need to handle specific formats or data structures that are not supported by the built-in encoding and decoding mechanisms. In this blog post, we will walk through the steps to implement custom encoding and decoding logic in Swift.

## Step 1: Define your custom data type

Before we can implement encoding and decoding logic, we first need to define the data type we want to work with. Let's assume we are working with a simple `Person` struct that has a name and age property:

```swift
struct Person: Codable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
}
```

## Step 2: Implement encoding logic

To implement encoding logic, you need to conform to the `Encodable` protocol and provide an implementation for the `encode(to:)` method. This method is responsible for encoding your custom data type into a specific format, such as JSON or XML.

In our example, we want to encode the `Person` struct into a JSON string:

```swift
struct Person: Codable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
    
    func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
        var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        try container.encode(name, forKey: .name)
        try container.encode(age, forKey: .age)
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Implement decoding logic

Similarly, to implement decoding logic, you need to conform to the `Decodable` protocol and provide an implementation for the `init(from:)` initializer. This initializer is responsible for decoding the data from a specific format and initializing your custom data type.

In our example, we want to decode a JSON string into the `Person` struct:

```swift
struct Person: Codable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
    
    init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        name = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .name)
        age = try container.decode(Int.self, forKey: .age)
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Test your encoding and decoding logic

Now that we have implemented the encoding and decoding logic for our `Person` struct, let's test it out:

```swift
let person = Person(name: "John Doe", age: 30)

let encoder = JSONEncoder()
let data = try encoder.encode(person)
let jsonString = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)
print(jsonString ?? "")

let decoder = JSONDecoder()
let decodedPerson = try decoder.decode(Person.self, from: data)
print(decodedPerson)
```

The above code creates a `Person` instance, encodes it as a JSON string, and then decodes it back into a `Person` struct. If everything is implemented correctly, the output should display the original `Person` data.

## Conclusion

By implementing custom encoding and decoding logic in Swift, you can handle data conversion in a way that suits your specific needs. This allows you to work with formats or data structures that are not natively supported by Swift's built-in mechanisms. Take advantage of the flexibility that Swift offers and create your own custom data encoding and decoding logic.
