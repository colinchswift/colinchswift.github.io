Transforming values before encoding them as JSON is a common requirement when working with APIs or data serialization in Swift. Swift provides a powerful encoding framework called `Codable`, which makes it easy to encode and decode JSON data. However, sometimes we need to apply custom transformations to the values before encoding them. In this blog post, we will explore how to encode JSON with custom value transformations in Swift.

## Understanding Codable and Encoding JSON

`Codable` is a protocol in Swift that combines the functionality of `Encodable` and `Decodable`. It provides a convenient way to serialize and deserialize Swift types to and from external representations, such as JSON.

When encoding JSON using `Codable`, Swift automatically converts the properties of a struct or class to JSON key-value pairs. By default, the encoding process is based on the property names. However, if we want to apply custom transformations on certain values before encoding them, we need to implement a custom encoding strategy.

## Implementing a Custom Encoding Strategy

To implement a custom encoding strategy, we need to conform to the `EncodingStrategy` protocol provided by the `Encoder` class. This protocol allows us to define how specific values should be transformed before encoding.

Here's an example of implementing a custom encoding strategy that converts a `String` property to lowercase before encoding:

```swift
struct User: Codable {
    var name: String
    var email: String
    
    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case name
        case email
    }
    
    func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
        var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        
        try container.encode(name.lowercased(), forKey: .name)
        try container.encode(email, forKey: .email)
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a custom `encode(to:)` method and use the `CodingKeys` enum to specify the properties we want to encode. Inside the `encode(to:)` method, we transform the `name` property using the `lowercased()` method before encoding it.

## Encoding JSON with the Custom Strategy

Now that we have implemented the custom encoding strategy, let's see how we can use it to encode JSON:

```swift
let user = User(name: "John Doe", email: "john.doe@example.com")

let encoder = JSONEncoder()
encoder.keyEncodingStrategy = .custom { keys in
    keys.last?.stringValue.lowercased()
}

do {
    let jsonData = try encoder.encode(user)
    let jsonString = String(data: jsonData, encoding: .utf8)
    print(jsonString ?? "")
} catch {
    print("Failed to encode JSON: \(error)")
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of `JSONEncoder` and set the `keyEncodingStrategy` to a custom closure. This closure takes an array of coding keys and returns the transformed string value for the last key. In our case, we transform the key to lowercase before encoding it as a JSON key.

By using a custom encoding strategy, we have control over how specific values are transformed before encoding them as JSON. This allows us to handle cases where we need to modify the representation of certain properties, such as applying transformations like lowercase conversion, uppercase conversion, or any other custom logic.
