Nowadays, most applications rely on APIs to fetch and exchange data with the server. As the APIs evolve, we often encounter scenarios where different versions of the same API exist. **Handling different API versions** becomes crucial to ensure backward compatibility and a smooth transition during updates.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use the `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` in Swift to handle different API versions seamlessly.

## JSONEncoder

The `JSONEncoder` class in Swift allows us to encode Swift types into JSON data. To support different API versions, we can override the `encode(to:)` method of our Encodable object as follows:

```swift
struct User: Encodable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int

    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case name
        case age
    }

    func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
        // Check the API version and encode accordingly
        var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        try container.encode(name, forKey: .name)
        if #available(iOS 13, *) {
            try container.encode(age, forKey: .age)
        } else {
            // For older API versions, encode age as a string
            try container.encode(String(age), forKey: .age)
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, we have a `User` struct with `name` and `age` properties. Inside the `encode(to:)` method, we check the API version (in this case, checking if the user's device is running iOS 13 or newer), and encode the `age` property accordingly. In the case of older API versions, we encode the `age` as a string.

## JSONDecoder

Similarly, the `JSONDecoder` class in Swift allows us to decode JSON data into Swift types. To handle different API versions, we can override the `init(from:)` method of our Decodable object:

```swift
struct User: Decodable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int

    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case name
        case age
    }

    init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        name = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .name)
        if #available(iOS 13, *) {
            age = try container.decode(Int.self, forKey: .age)
        } else {
            // For older API versions, decode age as a string and convert it to an integer
            let ageString = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .age)
            age = Int(ageString) ?? 0
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, we have a similar `User` struct with `name` and `age` properties. Inside the `init(from:)` method, we again check the API version and decode the `age` property accordingly. For older API versions, we decode the `age` as a string and convert it to an integer.

By implementing these customized `encode(to:)` and `init(from:)` methods, we can easily handle different API versions and ensure compatibility with different data formats.

## Conclusion

Supporting different API versions is essential for any application that relies on APIs for data exchange. By utilizing the `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` classes in Swift, we can handle these versions seamlessly. Customizing the encoding and decoding methods allows us to adapt to changes in the API structure while maintaining data integrity and backward compatibility.
