With the introduction of `Codable` in Swift 4, developers now have a more native and efficient way of working with JSON. Before Swift 4, many developers relied on third-party libraries like SwiftyJSON to parse and handle JSON data. However, with the availability of `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder`, it is much easier to manage JSON data without relying on external dependencies.

In this article, we will explore how to migrate from using SwiftyJSON to the native `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` in Swift.

## What is SwiftyJSON?

[SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON) is a popular third-party library that provides an extensive set of methods to parse, manipulate, and extract data from JSON objects. It offers a flexible and easy-to-use syntax for accessing JSON properties. However, using it often adds an additional layer of complexity to your codebase.

## What is Codable?

`Codable` is a protocol introduced in Swift 4 that combines the functionality of `Encodable` and `Decodable`. By adopting the `Codable` protocol, you can convert your Swift objects to/from JSON representation seamlessly.

## Step 1: Define your data model

Let's start by defining the data model that represents your JSON object. For this example, consider a simple `User` struct with `name` and `age` properties.

```swift
struct User: Codable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
}
```

## Step 2: Parsing JSON using JSONDecoder

To migrate from SwiftyJSON to `JSONDecoder`, begin by replacing your SwiftyJSON parsing code with `JSONDecoder` to parse the JSON data into your model object.

```swift
let jsonData = // Your JSON data here
do {
    let user = try JSONDecoder().decode(User.self, from: jsonData)
    // Access user properties like user.name and user.age
} catch {
    // Handle any decoding errors
}
```

## Step 3: Encoding data using JSONEncoder

To encode your model object back to JSON, use `JSONEncoder`:

```swift
do {
    let jsonData = try JSONEncoder().encode(user)
    // Use jsonData as needed
} catch {
    // Handle any encoding errors
}
```

## Benefits of migrating to JSONEncoder and JSONDecoder

There are several benefits to migrating from SwiftyJSON to `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder`:

- **Simplicity**: The native JSON APIs provide a cleaner and more straightforward way to work with JSON data.
- **Type Safety**: With `Codable`, Swift's type system ensures that the data you decode matches the structure of your data model.
- **Performance**: Native JSON encoding and decoding is highly optimized, leading to better performance compared to third-party libraries.

## Conclusion

By migrating from SwiftyJSON to `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder`, you can leverage the native JSON handling capabilities of Swift, resulting in cleaner code and improved performance. The built-in support for `Codable` makes it easier than ever to parse and encode JSON data. So, don't hesitate to embrace the power of Swift's native JSON handling APIs.
