When working with JSON in Swift, you might sometimes need to transform or modify the values before encoding them. This can be useful when you want to customize the encoding behavior or format the data in a specific way. In this article, we will explore how to transform JSON values during encoding in Swift.

## Using Codable and JSONEncoder

Swift's `Codable` protocol provides a convenient way to encode and decode JSON data. The `JSONEncoder` class is used to convert Swift objects to JSON data. To transform JSON values during encoding, we can leverage custom coding keys and custom encoding strategies.

## Custom Coding Keys

One way to transform JSON values is by using custom coding keys. Coding keys allow you to specify a different name for a property while encoding or decoding. This can be useful when you want to change the format or structure of the JSON data.

To implement custom coding keys, you need to create an `enum` that conforms to the `CodingKey` protocol. Each case in the enum represents a property you want to encode or decode.

Here's an example:

```swift
struct Person: Codable {
    var firstName: String
    var lastName: String

    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case firstName = "first_name"
        case lastName = "last_name"
    }
}

let person = Person(firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe")
let encoder = JSONEncoder()
let data = try encoder.encode(person)
let jsonString = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)
print(jsonString) // {"first_name":"John","last_name":"Doe"}
```

In the above example, we specified custom coding keys for the `firstName` and `lastName` properties. During encoding, the values will be encoded with the specified keys, resulting in a JSON string with `"first_name"` and `"last_name"` keys.

## Custom Encoding Strategies

Another way to transform JSON values is by using custom encoding strategies. Encoding strategies determine how a value should be encoded. Swift provides several built-in encoding strategies like `.convertToSnakeCase` and `.useDefaultKeys`.

To implement a custom encoding strategy, you need to create an instance of `JSONEncoder` and set its `keyEncodingStrategy` property to your desired strategy.

Here's an example:

```swift
struct Person: Codable {
    var firstName: String
    var lastName: String
}

let person = Person(firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe")
let encoder = JSONEncoder()
encoder.keyEncodingStrategy = .convertToSnakeCase

let data = try encoder.encode(person)
let jsonString = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)
print(jsonString) // {"first_name":"John","last_name":"Doe"}
```

In the above example, we set the `keyEncodingStrategy` of the `JSONEncoder` to `.convertToSnakeCase`. This strategy converts the property names to snake case during encoding, resulting in a JSON string with `"first_name"` and `"last_name"` keys.

## Conclusion

Transforming JSON values during encoding in Swift can be achieved using custom coding keys or custom encoding strategies. Custom coding keys allow you to specify a different name for a property, while custom encoding strategies determine how a value should be encoded. By leveraging these techniques, you can customize the encoding behavior to meet your specific requirements.
