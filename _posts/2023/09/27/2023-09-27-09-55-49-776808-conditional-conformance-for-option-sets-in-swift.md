Option sets are a powerful feature in Swift that allow you to create a collection of distinct values using a bitwise OR operator. They provide a concise way of representing a set of options or flags. However, there are cases when we want to use option sets with associated types and conditionally conform them to different protocols. This is where Swift's conditional conformance comes into play.

Conditional conformance allows us to declare that a generic type conforms to a protocol only in certain circumstances. In the case of option sets, we can conditionally conform them to protocols based on the types they contain.

## Basic Option Set

Let's start with a basic implementation of an option set called `MyOptionSet`.

```swift
struct MyOptionSet: OptionSet {
    let rawValue: Int
    
    static let option1 = MyOptionSet(rawValue: 1 << 0)
    static let option2 = MyOptionSet(rawValue: 1 << 1)
    static let option3 = MyOptionSet(rawValue: 1 << 2)
}
```

## Conditional Conformance

Now, let's say we have a protocol called `CustomProtocol`, and we want to conditionally conform `MyOptionSet` to this protocol based on the types it contains. For example, if `MyOptionSet` contains `Int`, it should conform to `CustomProtocol`, but if it contains other types, it should not conform.

```swift
protocol CustomProtocol {
    func doSomething()
}

extension MyOptionSet: CustomProtocol where RawValue == Int {
    func doSomething() {
        print("Doing something with options \(self)")
    }
}
```

In the above code, we use the `where` clause to specify that `MyOptionSet` should only conform to `CustomProtocol` if the `RawValue` is of type `Int`. This allows us to conditionally add functionality to `MyOptionSet` based on its underlying type.

## Usage

Let's see how we can use our `MyOptionSet` with its conditional conformance.

```swift
let options: MyOptionSet = [.option1, .option2]

if let conformingOptions = options as? CustomProtocol {
    conformingOptions.doSomething()
} else {
    print("Options do not conform to CustomProtocol")
}
```

In the above code, we check if `options` conform to `CustomProtocol` using optional type casting. If the cast is successful, we can call the `doSomething()` method. Otherwise, we can handle the case when `options` do not conform to `CustomProtocol`.

## Conclusion

Conditional conformance in Swift provides us with a powerful tool to conditionally conform a type to a protocol based on certain conditions. This is especially useful when working with option sets that may contain different underlying types. By using conditional conformance, we can extend their functionality in a flexible and type-safe manner.
