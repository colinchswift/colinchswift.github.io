## Introduction

Swift is a powerful and expressive programming language that offers a wide range of features. One such feature is **conditional conformance**, which allows us to conditionally conform types to protocols based on certain conditions. In this blog post, we will explore how we can leverage conditional conformance for compile-time reflection in Swift.

## What is Compile-Time Reflection?

Compile-time reflection refers to the ability of a programming language to inspect and manipulate its own code at compile-time. It allows us to retrieve information about types, properties, and methods, and perform operations based on that information.

## Conditional Conformance in Swift

Swift introduced **conditional conformance** in version 4.1, which allows us to specify conditions under which a type automatically conforms to a protocol. This enables us to define more flexible and generic APIs.

## Use Case: Compile-Time Reflection for Codable Types

To demonstrate conditional conformance for compile-time reflection, let's consider the use case of applying it to Codable types. The Codable protocol in Swift allows us to encode and decode types from and to various representations, such as JSON or binary data.

Let's say we have a generic type `KeyPathCodingKey` that represents a coding key for a key path:

```swift
struct KeyPathCodingKey<T>: CodingKey {
    var stringValue: String
    var intValue: Int?

    init?(stringValue: String) {
        self.stringValue = stringValue
    }

    init?(intValue: Int) {
        self.stringValue = "\(intValue)"
        self.intValue = intValue
    }
}
```

We can conform `KeyPathCodingKey` to the Codable protocol conditionally based on the type it represents:

```swift
extension KeyPathCodingKey: Codable where T: Codable { }
```

With conditional conformance, we can now encode and decode any type that conforms to Codable using key paths!

## Conclusion

Conditional conformance in Swift is a powerful feature that facilitates the use of compile-time reflection. By conditionally conforming types to protocols, we can create more flexible and generic code that adapts to different conditions. In our example, we showcased how conditional conformance enables compile-time reflection for Codable types. This is just one of the many applications of conditional conformance in Swift, and it opens up a world of possibilities for writing more expressive and generic code.
