When working with JSON data in Swift, it is common to have optional values, which may or may not be present in the JSON. Swift's `Decodable` protocol provides a convenient way to decode JSON into custom model objects.

In this article, we will explore how to decode JSON with optional values using Swift's `Decodable` protocol.

## Defining the Model

Let's start by defining a simple model structure that represents the JSON data we want to decode. Suppose we have the following JSON structure:

```swift
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "johndoe@example.com"
}
```

To decode this JSON, we can create a Swift struct that conforms to the `Decodable` protocol. We'll define optional properties for the values that might be missing in the JSON:

```swift
struct Person: Decodable {
    var name: String
    var age: Int?
    var email: String?
}
```

Here, the `name` property is required, while `age` and `email` are optional.

## Decoding JSON

To decode the JSON data into the `Person` object, we can use `JSONDecoder` provided by Swift's Foundation framework. Here's an example of how to decode the JSON:

```swift
let json = """
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "johndoe@example.com"
}
"""

let jsonData = json.data(using: .utf8)!

do {
    let person = try JSONDecoder().decode(Person.self, from: jsonData)
    print(person)
} catch {
    print("Error decoding JSON: \(error)")
}
```

We start by converting the JSON string into `Data` using the `data(using: .utf8)` method. Then, we use `JSONDecoder` to decode the JSON data into a `Person` object. If any required fields are missing or the decoding fails, an error will be thrown.

## Handling Optional Values

With the optional properties in the `Person` struct, Swift will automatically handle cases where the values are absent in the JSON. If a value is present in the JSON, it will be assigned to the corresponding property. If not, the optional property will be `nil`.

For example, suppose we have the following JSON without the email field:

```swift
let json = """
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30
}
"""
```

When decoding this JSON into the `Person` object, the value of `email` will be `nil`. You can safely use optional chaining to access optional values without causing a runtime error.

## Conclusion

Decoding JSON with optional values in Swift is straightforward using the `Decodable` protocol. By defining optional properties in your model, you can handle cases where certain values may be missing from the JSON.

Using Swift's `JSONDecoder`, you can smoothly parse and decode JSON data into custom model objects, allowing you to work with JSON data in a type-safe and structured manner.
