JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular data format used for storing and exchanging data between a client and a server. In Swift, you can easily encode Swift types into JSON using the built-in `JSONEncoder` class. However, there may be cases where you want to customize the encoding process, such as handling date formats, omitting certain properties, or transforming the data to fit specific requirements.

In this blog post, we will explore how to encode JSON with custom encoding strategies in Swift using the `Codable` protocol and the `JSONEncoder` class.

## The Codable Protocol

`Codable` is a protocol introduced in Swift 4 that allows you to easily convert Swift types to and from external representations, such as JSON. By adopting the `Codable` protocol, your types automatically gain the ability to encode and decode themselves.

To customize the encoding process, you can provide your own implementation of the `encode(to:)` method from the `Encodable` protocol, which is included by default in the `Codable` protocol.

Suppose we have a `Person` struct that we want to encode into JSON:

```swift
struct Person: Codable {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
}
```

## Custom Encoding Strategy

To encode the `Person` struct with a custom encoding strategy, we can create a custom `EncodingStrategy` by conforming to the `KeyedEncodingContainerProtocol` protocol.

Let's say we want to convert the `name` property to uppercase when encoding it into JSON. We can achieve this by creating a custom encoding strategy:

```swift
struct UppercaseEncodingStrategy: KeyedEncodingContainerProtocol {
    var codingPath: [CodingKey] = []
    var encoder: Encoder
    
    init(encoder: Encoder, codingPath: [CodingKey]) {
        self.encoder = encoder
        self.codingPath = codingPath
    }
    
    mutating func encode(_ value: String, forKey key: KeyedEncodingContainerProtocol.Key) throws {
        try encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self).encode(value.uppercased(), forKey: key)
    }
    
    // ... other methods from KeyedEncodingContainerProtocol
}
```

## Encoding Using the Custom Strategy

To encode a `Person` instance with our custom encoding strategy, we need to create an instance of `JSONEncoder` and set our custom strategy as the `keyEncodingStrategy`:

```swift
let person = Person(name: "John Doe", age: 30)
let encoder = JSONEncoder()
encoder.keyEncodingStrategy = .custom { codingKeys in
    return UppercaseEncodingStrategy(encoder: encoder, codingPath: codingKeys.codingPath)
}

do {
    let jsonData = try encoder.encode(person)
    if let jsonString = String(data: jsonData, encoding: .utf8) {
        print(jsonString)
    }
} catch {
    print("Error encoding JSON: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

Now, when we encode our `Person` instance, the `name` property will be converted to uppercase before being encoded into JSON.

## Conclusion

Custom encoding strategies provide flexibility when encoding JSON in Swift. By conforming to the `KeyedEncodingContainerProtocol` protocol and implementing the necessary methods, you can customize the encoding process to fit your specific requirements. This allows you to handle custom data transformations, omit certain properties, or format your data in a way suitable for your needs.

With the `Codable` protocol and the `JSONEncoder` class in Swift, you have powerful tools at your disposal for encoding and decoding JSON data efficiently and effectively.
