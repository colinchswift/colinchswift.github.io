In Swift, protocols can have [associated types](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Generics.html#ID193) or requirements that depend on the conforming types themselves. These requirements may involve the usage of the `Self` keyword or associated types, which can make it challenging to achieve conditional conformance.

Conditional conformance in Swift allows you to define conformance to a protocol only under certain conditions. This feature is incredibly useful when working with protocols that have self or associated type requirements.

## Example Scenario
Let's consider an example scenario where we have a protocol `EquatableContainer`. This protocol requires the conforming type to be a collection of elements that are equatable.

```swift
protocol EquatableContainer {
    associatedtype Element: Equatable
    var elements: [Element] { get set }
    func contains(_ element: Element) -> Bool
}
```

Now, we want to make an extension for arrays (`[Element]`) to conform to `EquatableContainer` if the `Element` type itself is equatable. Without conditional conformance, the array would need to conform to `Equatable` itself, which is not what we desire.

## Conditional Conformance using where Clauses
In Swift 4 and later, we can use the `where` clause to achieve conditional conformance. Here's how we can achieve conditional conformance for the array type:

```swift
extension Array: EquatableContainer where Element: Equatable {
    func contains(_ element: Element) -> Bool {
        return elements.contains(element)
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `Array` type will only conform to `EquatableContainer` if `Element` is equatable. The `where` clause specifies this condition.

## Limitations of Conditional Conformance
It's important to note that conditional conformance in Swift has some limitations. For protocols with self or associated type requirements, conditional conformance can only be achieved using the `where` clause. Conditional conformances based on runtime conditions are not supported in Swift.

## Conclusion
Conditional conformance allows us to define conformance to protocols with self or associated type requirements only under certain conditions. By using the `where` clause, we can conditionally conform types to protocols in Swift, making our code more flexible, reusable, and expressive.
