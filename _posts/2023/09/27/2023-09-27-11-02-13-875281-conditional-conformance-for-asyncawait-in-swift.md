Swift 5.5 introduced the `async/await` pattern, which allows for writing asynchronous code in a more sequential manner. With this new concurrency model comes the need for conditional conformance to certain protocols based on the availability of the `Task` type. In this blog post, we will explore how to use conditional conformance for `async/await` in Swift.

## Background

Conditional conformance is a feature in Swift that allows a generic type to conform to a protocol only under certain conditions. This is particularly useful when dealing with optional types or types with specific configurations.

## Using Conditional Conformance with `Task`

The `Task` type in Swift is the fundamental unit of asynchronous programming when using `async/await`. It represents a handle to an asynchronous task that can be awaited upon. We can use conditional conformance to specify that a type conforms to a protocol only if the `Task` type is available.

Let's look at an example of this in action:

```swift
protocol MyProtocol {
    func doSomething() async
}

struct MyStruct<TaskType> {
    // Conditionally conform MyStruct to MyProtocol if TaskType is of type Task
    where TaskType: Task, Self: MyProtocol {
    // ...
}
```

In the example above, we define a generic struct `MyStruct` that conditionally conforms to the `MyProtocol` protocol if `TaskType` is of type `Task`. This means that `MyStruct` will only conform to `MyProtocol` when running on platforms that support `Task`.

## Benefits of Conditional Conformance

By using conditional conformance, we can write more flexible and reusable code that adapts to the available concurrency model. This allows us to write async/await code that can be used across different platforms and versions of Swift, ensuring compatibility and improving code maintainability.

## Conclusion

Conditional conformance in Swift enables us to write code that adapts to the `async/await` concurrency model based on the availability of `Task`. It provides us with the flexibility to write code that is compatible with different platforms and versions of Swift. By leveraging this feature, we can create more reusable and maintainable async/await code.
