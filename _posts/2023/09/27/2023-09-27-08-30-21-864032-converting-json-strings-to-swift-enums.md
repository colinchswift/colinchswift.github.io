Working with JSON data is a common task in iOS app development. JSON strings are often parsed and mapped to specific model objects for easier manipulation. In some cases, it can be advantageous to represent certain JSON values as Swift enums rather than just using raw strings. In this blog post, we will explore how to convert JSON strings to Swift enums.

## Why Use Swift Enums?

Swift enums provide a safer and more structured way to handle JSON data. They can limit the possible values for a particular property, making it easier to handle data consistency and avoid runtime errors. By converting JSON strings to enums, we can benefit from the type safety and improved code readability provided by Swift.

## Creating a Swift Enum

To convert a JSON string to a Swift enum, we first need to define the enum with all the possible cases. Each enum case should represent a distinct value from the JSON data. Let's say we have a JSON object with a "status" property that can have three possible string values: "success", "failure", and "pending". We can define a Swift enum like this:

```swift
enum Status: String {
    case success = "success"
    case failure = "failure"
    case pending = "pending"
}
```

Here, the `Status` enum is defined with three cases: `success`, `failure`, and `pending`. The associated values for each case are set to their corresponding JSON string values.

## Parsing JSON to Swift Enum

Once we have the enum defined, we can parse the JSON string and convert it to the enum value. The process typically involves decoding the JSON data using a JSON decoder provided by Swift's `Codable` protocol. Here's an example of how we can decode a JSON string and convert a "status" property to the `Status` enum:

```swift
let json = """
{
    "status": "success"
}
"""

struct Response: Codable {
    let status: Status
}

do {
    let data = json.data(using: .utf8)!
    let response = try JSONDecoder().decode(Response.self, from: data)
    
    // Access the status enum value
    print(response.status) // Output: success
} catch {
    print("Failed to decode JSON: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

In the example above, we define a `Response` model struct with a `status` property of type `Status`. We then use `JSONDecoder` to decode the JSON string into an instance of the `Response` struct. Finally, we can access the `status` property as a Swift enum value.

## Handling Unknown or Invalid JSON Values

Sometimes, JSON data can contain unexpected or invalid values for a particular property. In such cases, it's important to handle those scenarios gracefully. One approach is to introduce an additional enum case, such as `unknown`, to handle unrecognized values. Here's an updated version of the `Status` enum with an `unknown` case:

```swift
enum Status: String {
    case success = "success"
    case failure = "failure"
    case pending = "pending"
    case unknown
}
```

By adding an `unknown` case, we can handle unknown or unexpected values encountered during JSON parsing.

## Conclusion

Converting JSON strings to Swift enums provides a more structured and type safe way to handle JSON data in iOS app development. By doing this, we can take advantage of Swift's powerful enum feature to enforce data consistency and improve code readability. It allows us to handle JSON values more safely and effectively in our apps.
