Conditional conformance is a powerful feature introduced in Swift that allows you to customize the behavior of a generic type depending on certain conditions. It enables you to extend a generic type to conform to a protocol only if certain requirements are met. This feature brings flexibility and expressivity to your code, allowing you to define behavior for specific cases. In this blog post, we will explore how conditional conformance can be used to customize the behavior of generic types in Swift.

## What is Conditional Conformance?

Conditional conformance allows you to specify that a generic type conforms to a protocol only when certain conditions are met. This allows you to define different behavior for specific cases. By using conditional conformance, you can extend a generic type to conform to a protocol when the generic parameter satisfies certain constraints.

## Example Scenario

Let's consider an example scenario where we have a generic `Container` type that can hold multiple values. We want to customize the behavior of the `Container` type to conform to the `Equatable` protocol only if the generic type it contains is also `Equatable`.

```swift
struct Container<T> {
    let value: T
}

extension Container: Equatable where T: Equatable {
    static func ==(lhs: Container<T>, rhs: Container<T>) -> Bool {
        return lhs.value == rhs.value
    }
}
```

In this example, we extend the `Container` type to conform to the `Equatable` protocol only if the generic type `T` conforms to `Equatable`. This way, we ensure that we can compare two `Container` instances only if their underlying values are equatable. Any attempt to compare two `Container` instances with non-equatable types will result in a compile-time error.

## Conditional Conformance for Optional Type

The optional type in Swift, represented by the `Optional` enum, is a great use case for conditional conformance. By default, the optional type is not equatable. However, you can customize the behavior of optional types and make them equatable if the underlying type is equatable.

Let's take a look at an example:

```swift
extension Optional: Equatable where Wrapped: Equatable {
    static func ==(lhs: Optional<Wrapped>, rhs: Optional<Wrapped>) -> Bool {
        switch (lhs, rhs) {
        case (.some(let value1), .some(let value2)):
            return value1 == value2
        case (.none, .none):
            return true
        default:
            return false
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we extend the `Optional` type to conform to the `Equatable` protocol only if the wrapped type `Wrapped` is equatable. We then provide an implementation for the `==` operator that compares the wrapped values for equality. However, if either of the optionals is `nil`, we return `true` only if both optionals are `nil`. This ensures that optional types with equatable underlying types can be compared for equality.

## Conclusion

Conditional conformance in Swift is a powerful feature that allows you to customize the behavior of generic types and make them conform to protocols only under certain conditions. It brings flexibility and expressivity to your code, enabling you to define behavior for specific cases. By leveraging conditional conformance, you can make your code cleaner and more concise while ensuring type safety. So go ahead and start customizing the behavior of your generic types with conditional conformance!
