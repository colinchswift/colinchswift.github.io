When working with JSON data in Swift, the `JSONDecoder` class is commonly used to decode the JSON into Swift objects. However, there are certain scenarios where we may want to provide additional information or customize the decoding process. This is where the `userInfo` property of `JSONDecoder` comes in handy.

The `userInfo` dictionary is a property of `JSONDecoder` that allows us to pass in additional information to customize the decoding process. It can be used to provide contextual information to the decoder, such as key coding strategies, data formatting options, or any other custom behavior we might need.

To use the `userInfo` dictionary with `JSONDecoder`, we can follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of `JSONDecoder`:
```swift
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
```

2. Initialize the `userInfo` dictionary with any desired custom information. For example, let's say we want to specify a specific date decoding strategy:
```swift
let dateDecodingStrategy = DateFormatter.myCustomDateDecodingStrategy
let userInfo = [CodingUserInfoKey.dateDecodingStrategy: dateDecodingStrategy]
```

3. Assign the `userInfo` dictionary to the `userInfo` property of the decoder:
```swift
decoder.userInfo = userInfo
```

4. Use the decoder to decode the JSON data into Swift objects as usual:
```swift
let jsonString = """
{"name": "John", "age": 30, "dob": "2022-01-01"}
"""

let jsonData = jsonString.data(using: .utf8)

do {
    let person = try decoder.decode(Person.self, from: jsonData)
    // Process the decoded person object
} catch {
    // Handle any decoding errors
}
```

By setting the `userInfo` dictionary on the `JSONDecoder`, we can now access and utilize the custom information during the decoding process.

## Conclusion

The `userInfo` dictionary of `JSONDecoder` in Swift provides a way to pass in custom information and customize the decoding process. This allows for greater flexibility and control when working with JSON data. Whether it's specifying date decoding strategies, custom key coding strategies, or any other desired custom behavior, the `userInfo` dictionary is a powerful tool in the JSON decoding workflow.
