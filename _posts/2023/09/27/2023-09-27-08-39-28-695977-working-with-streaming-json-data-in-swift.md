JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely-used data format for transmitting data between a server and a client application. In Swift, there are several libraries available that allow us to parse and manipulate JSON data easily. However, these libraries typically require that the entire JSON file is loaded into memory before parsing, which can be problematic when working with large or continuously streaming JSON data.

In this blog post, we'll explore how to work with streaming JSON data in Swift, allowing us to process large files or continuous streams without loading the entire data into memory.

## Using the `JSONSerialization` API

Swift provides the `JSONSerialization` class, which allows us to parse JSON data. By default, `JSONSerialization` expects the entire JSON data to be available upfront. However, we can work around this limitation by using the `JSONSerialization.ReadingOptions` `.allowFragments` option and streaming the data ourselves.

Here's an example of how we can stream JSON data using `JSONSerialization`:

```swift
import Foundation

func parseStreamingJSONData(data: Data) {
    var startIndex = data.startIndex
    var endIndex = data.startIndex
    
    while endIndex < data.endIndex {
        if let range = data[startIndex...].range(of: "\n") {
            endIndex = range.lowerBound
        } else {
            endIndex = data.endIndex
        }
        
        let chunkData = data[startIndex..<endIndex]
        if let jsonObject = try? JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: chunkData, options: .allowFragments) {
            // Process the JSON object
            print(jsonObject)
        }
        
        startIndex = endIndex + 1
    }
}
```

In the above example, we define a function `parseStreamingJSONData` that takes a `Data` object representing the JSON data. We then iterate over the data and use the newline character (`"\n"`) as a delimiter to split the data into chunks. Each chunk is then passed to `JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with:options:)` to parse it as a JSON object. We can then process the JSON object as needed.

## Handling Continuous Streaming JSON Data

When working with continuous streaming JSON data, where the JSON data keeps coming in real-time, we can use a combination of techniques to handle the data efficiently.

First, we can use an asynchronous network library such as `URLSession` to download and stream the JSON data continuously. We can then use the techniques explained above to parse and process the streamed data as it arrives.

Here's an example of how we can handle continuous streaming JSON data using `URLSession`:

```swift
import Foundation

class JSONStreamReader: NSObject, URLSessionDataDelegate {
    private var buffer = Data()
    
    func URLSession(_ session: URLSession, dataTask: URLSessionDataTask, didReceive data: Data) {
        buffer.append(data)
        
        while let newlineRange = buffer.range(of: "\n") {
            let chunkData = buffer[buffer.startIndex..<newlineRange.lowerBound]
            buffer.removeSubrange(buffer.startIndex..<newlineRange.upperBound)
            
            if let jsonObject = try? JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: chunkData, options: .allowFragments) {
                // Process the JSON object
                print(jsonObject)
            }
        }
    }
}

let url = URL(string: "https://example.com/continuous-streaming-json")!
let session = URLSession(configuration: .default, delegate: JSONStreamReader(), delegateQueue: nil)
let task = session.dataTask(with: url)
task.resume()
```

In this example, we create a custom `JSONStreamReader` class that implements the `URLSessionDataDelegate` protocol. This allows us to receive the streamed JSON data as it arrives. The received data is appended to a buffer, and we continue processing the buffer by splitting it into newline-separated chunks using the techniques explained earlier.

Finally, we create a `URLSession` with our custom `JSONStreamReader` delegate and initiate a data task to start streaming the JSON data from the specified URL.

By combining the power of Swift's `JSONSerialization` class and techniques for streaming data, we can efficiently work with streaming JSON data in Swift.
