When working with third-party libraries in Swift that do not conform to the `Codable` protocol, you may run into situations where you need to convert their data structures to or from JSON. This can be a common requirement when integrating APIs or handling data persistence.

Luckily, Swift provides an easy way to handle this conversion using `Codable`, but it requires some additional steps to make it work with third-party libraries. In this blog post, we will explore how to use `Codable` with third-party libraries and demonstrate it with an example.

## Step 1: Create a Wrapper Struct

The first step is to create a new struct that serves as a wrapper for the third-party library's data structure. This wrapper struct will conform to the `Codable` protocol and handle the conversion between the third-party data structure and JSON.

```swift
struct LibraryWrapper: Codable {
    let libraryProperty1: String
    let libraryProperty2: Int
}
```

In this example, we create a `LibraryWrapper` struct that wraps the third-party library's data structure. We define the properties that need to be encoded and decoded to and from JSON.

## Step 2: Implement Codable Methods

The next step is to implement the `Codable` methods in the wrapper struct. The `Codable` protocol requires implementing two methods - `encode(to encoder: Encoder)` and `init(from decoder: Decoder)`.

```swift
struct LibraryWrapper: Codable {
    let libraryProperty1: String
    let libraryProperty2: Int

    // Encoding
    func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
        var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        try container.encode(libraryProperty1, forKey: .libraryProperty1)
        try container.encode(libraryProperty2, forKey: .libraryProperty2)
    }

    // Decoding
    init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        libraryProperty1 = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .libraryProperty1)
        libraryProperty2 = try container.decode(Int.self, forKey: .libraryProperty2)
    }

    // Coding keys
    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case libraryProperty1
        case libraryProperty2
    }
}
```

Here, we use the `CodingKeys` enum to specify the keys for the properties when encoding and decoding. In the `encode(to encoder: Encoder)` method, we encode each property to the encoder. In the `init(from decoder: Decoder)` method, we decode the properties from the decoder.

## Step 3: Convert to/from JSON

With the `LibraryWrapper` struct in place, you can now easily convert the third-party library's data structure to JSON using `JSONEncoder` and back from JSON using `JSONDecoder`. You can use these methods throughout your codebase to easily convert between the library's data structure and JSON.

```swift
let libraryData = // Get library data from third-party library

do {
    // Convert to JSON
    let jsonData = try JSONEncoder().encode(LibraryWrapper(libraryProperty1: libraryData.property1, libraryProperty2: libraryData.property2))
    let jsonString = String(data: jsonData, encoding: .utf8)

    // Convert from JSON
    let decodedData = try JSONDecoder().decode(LibraryWrapper.self, from: jsonData)
    // Use the decoded data
} catch {
    print("Error: \(error)")
}
```

In this example, we assume `libraryData` is the data obtained from the third-party library. We use `JSONEncoder` to convert it to JSON and `JSONDecoder` to decode it back to the `LibraryWrapper` struct.

## Conclusion

Using `Codable` with third-party libraries in Swift is a powerful way to handle the conversion between third-party data structures and JSON. By creating a wrapper struct that conforms to `Codable` and implementing the required methods, you can easily convert data to and from JSON. This approach provides a flexible and maintainable solution when working with third-party libraries that do not conform to `Codable`. #Swift #Codable
