Conditional conformance is a powerful feature in Swift that allows types to conform to protocols selectively, based on certain conditions. This feature was introduced in Swift 4.1 and has since become a valuable tool in writing flexible and reusable code.

## Overview

In Swift, a protocol defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that types can adopt. With conditional conformance, we can define specific criteria under which a type should conform to a protocol. This enables us to write generic algorithms that work with different types while maintaining type safety.

## Example

Let's consider a simple example involving a generic `Stack` structure that conforms conditionally to the `Equatable` protocol. The `Stack` structure represents a last-in, first-out (LIFO) collection of elements.

```swift
struct Stack<Element>: Equatable where Element: Equatable {
    private var elements: [Element] = []
    
    mutating func push(_ element: Element) {
        elements.append(element)
    }
    
    mutating func pop() -> Element? {
        return elements.popLast()
    }
    
    static func ==(lhs: Stack<Element>, rhs: Stack<Element>) -> Bool {
        return lhs.elements == rhs.elements
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Stack` structure conforms to `Equatable` only if its generic `Element` type also conforms to `Equatable`. This allows us to compare two instances of `Stack` for equality using the `==` operator.

## Pattern Matching

Another powerful feature in Swift is pattern matching. It allows us to match and extract values from complex data types, such as tuples, enums, and structs. We can use pattern matching to make our code more expressive and concise.

Let's look at an example that demonstrates pattern matching with enums. Consider an `HTTPResponse` enum that represents different types of HTTP responses.

```swift
enum HTTPResponse {
    case success(statusCode: Int)
    case failure(errorCode: Int)
}

// Pattern matching in a switch statement
func processResponse(_ response: HTTPResponse) {
    switch response {
    case .success(let statusCode):
        print("Request succeeded with status code: \(statusCode)")
        
    case .failure(let errorCode):
        print("Request failed with error code: \(errorCode)")
    }
}
```

In this example, we use pattern matching in a switch statement to handle different cases of the `HTTPResponse` enum. We extract the associated values using the `let` keyword and perform the appropriate actions based on the matched case.

## Conclusion

Conditional conformance and pattern matching are powerful features in Swift that enhance the flexibility and expressiveness of our code. With conditional conformance, we can selectively conform types to protocols based on specific conditions, enabling us to write more reusable code. Pattern matching allows us to match and extract values from complex data types, making our code more concise and expressive.
