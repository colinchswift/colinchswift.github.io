Lazy collections are a powerful feature in Swift that allow for delayed evaluation of elements. It can be useful in scenarios where you want to avoid unnecessary computations or memory usage until the elements are actually accessed.

Swift 4.1 introduced conditional conformance, which enables certain types to conform to a protocol only if their type arguments also conform to certain protocols. This feature enhances the flexibility and expressiveness of Swift's type system. In this blog post, we will explore how to leverage conditional conformance with lazy collections in Swift.

## Understanding Conditional Conformance

Conditional conformance allows us to define a generic type that conforms to a protocol only if a certain condition is met for its type arguments. This feature is particularly useful when dealing with collections and protocols.

For example, let's take a look at a simple protocol called `EquatableCollection` that requires a collection element to be equatable:

```swift
protocol EquatableCollection {
    associatedtype Element: Equatable
    var elements: [Element] { get }
}
```

In previous versions of Swift, if we had a struct `LazyEquatableCollection` with a lazy collection of equatable elements, we would have to explicitly make it conform to `Equatable` by providing an implementation for `static func ==`:

```swift
struct LazyEquatableCollection<Element: Equatable>: EquatableCollection {
    var elements: [Element]

    static func ==(lhs: LazyEquatableCollection<Element>, rhs: LazyEquatableCollection<Element>) -> Bool {
        return lhs.elements == rhs.elements
    }
}
```

However, with Swift's conditional conformance, we can now avoid the need for this boilerplate code.

## Conditional Conformance for Lazy Collections

With conditional conformance, we can declare that `LazyCollection` conforms to `EquatableCollection` only if its element type is `Equatable`. This eliminates the need for an explicit conformance implementation.

```swift
extension LazyCollection: EquatableCollection where Element: Equatable {
    var elements: [Element] { return Array(self) }
}
```

Now, any lazy collection whose element type is equatable will automatically conform to `EquatableCollection`. This means that we can compare two instances of `LazyCollection` for equality without having to provide an explicit `==` implementation.

## Conclusion

Conditional conformance in Swift provides a powerful tool for defining protocol conformance based on certain conditions. With its help, we can easily extend the behavior of lazy collections in a more concise and elegant way.

By leveraging conditional conformance, we've seen how we can automatically make lazy collections conform to a protocol if their element type satisfies certain requirements. This reduces boilerplate code and enhances the readability and maintainability of our codebase.
