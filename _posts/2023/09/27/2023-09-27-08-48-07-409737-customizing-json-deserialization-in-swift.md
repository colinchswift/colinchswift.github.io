When working with JSON in Swift, you might come across scenarios where you need to customize the deserialization process to better fit your data model. Fortunately, Swift provides a flexible and powerful mechanism for doing this. In this blog post, we'll explore some techniques for customizing JSON deserialization in Swift.

## Using Codable

The Codable protocol in Swift allows you to easily serialize and deserialize JSON data. By default, Codable applies a set of rules for mapping the JSON keys to your data model properties. However, there may be cases where you want to customize this mapping behavior.

### Renaming JSON Keys

One common customization is to rename the JSON keys to match specific property names in your data model. To accomplish this, you can use the `CodingKeys` enum provided by the Codable protocol.

```swift
struct User: Codable {
    let id: Int
    let username: String
    let email: String

    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case id = "user_id"
        case username = "user_name"
        case email
    }
}
```

In the above example, the JSON keys `"user_id"` and `"user_name"` will be mapped to `id` and `username` properties, respectively. The `email` property remains the same since the JSON key matches its name.

### Ignoring Properties

Sometimes you may want to ignore certain properties during JSON deserialization, for example, calculated properties or properties that receive values from elsewhere in your code. You can achieve this by implementing the `init(from:)` initializer.

```swift
struct User: Codable {
    let id: Int
    let username: String
    let email: String

    var isVerified: Bool {
        // Calculated property
        return true
    }

    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case id
        case username
        case email
    }

    init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        id = try container.decode(Int.self, forKey: .id)
        username = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .username)
        email = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .email)

        // Ignore additional properties
        _ = try container.decodeIfPresent(Bool.self, forKey: .isVerified)
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `isVerified` property is a computed property that is not present in the JSON. By decoding it using `decodeIfPresent`, we can ignore this property during deserialization.

## Conclusion

Customizing JSON deserialization in Swift is a powerful technique that allows you to fine-tune the mapping between JSON and your data model. Whether it's renaming keys or ignoring properties, Swift's Codable protocol provides an easy and flexible way to achieve this customization.
