In Swift, working with JSON is quite common when interacting with APIs or persisting data. Sometimes, we might have optional properties in our Swift structs or classes that we want to encode into JSON. In this blog post, we will explore how to encode JSON with optional values in Swift using the `Codable` protocol.

## The `Codable` Protocol

The `Codable` protocol in Swift provides a simple way to encode and decode data to and from JSON. It combines the functionality of the `Encodable` and `Decodable` protocols, enabling us to easily serialize and deserialize data.

## Encoding JSON

To encode JSON with optional values, we need to take a few additional steps in our Swift structs or classes.

### Step 1: Conform to the `Codable` Protocol

First, make sure your struct or class conforms to the `Codable` protocol. For example:

```swift
struct Person: Codable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int?
    let address: String?
}
```

In the above example, the properties `age` and `address` are optional.

### Step 2: Implement the Coding Keys

Next, we need to implement an enum called `CodingKeys` within our struct or class, which will specify the mapping between our Swift properties and the corresponding JSON keys. For optional properties, we can add a `case` for each property and mark it as optional using the `?` operator. For example:

```swift
struct Person: Codable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int?
    let address: String?
    
    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case name
        case age
        case address
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Encode the JSON

To encode our struct into JSON, we can use an instance of `JSONEncoder`. We'll need to handle any possible errors that may occur during the encoding process. For example:

```swift
let person = Person(name: "John Doe", age: nil, address: "123 Main St")
let encoder = JSONEncoder()
let jsonData = try? encoder.encode(person)
if let jsonData = jsonData {
    let jsonString = String(data: jsonData, encoding: .utf8)
    print(jsonString)
}
```

The above code creates an instance of `Person` and encodes it into JSON using `JSONEncoder`. The encoded JSON data is then converted to a string and printed to the console.

## Conclusion

Working with JSON in Swift becomes straightforward with the `Codable` protocol. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily encode JSON with optional values. With this knowledge, you'll be able to work with APIs and persist data more effectively in your Swift applications.
