In Swift, working with JSON data is a common task when building mobile apps or interacting with web services. The `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` classes provide a convenient way to encode and decode JSON data. Combining these classes with the `Combine` framework can make your code more reactive and streamline your data processing pipelines.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need a basic understanding of Swift and the Combine framework. If you're new to Combine, I recommend checking out Apple's [Combine documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine).

## Step 1: Import the Required Frameworks

To get started, you need to import the necessary frameworks into your Swift file:

```swift
import Foundation
import Combine
```

The `Foundation` framework provides the `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` classes, while the `Combine` framework allows us to work with asynchronous tasks in a reactive manner.

## Step 2: Create a Codable Model

Next, create a `Codable` model that represents the structure of your JSON data. For example, let's say we have a `Book` model with `title`, `author`, and `year` properties:

```swift
struct Book: Codable {
    let title: String
    let author: String
    let year: Int
}
```

## Step 3: Encode JSON Data

To encode an instance of your `Codable` model into JSON data, you can use the `JSONEncoder` class. Combine provides us with the `Future` publisher, which allows us to work with single value asynchronous tasks. Here's an example of how to encode a `Book` into JSON data:

```swift
func encodeBook(book: Book) -> Future<Data, Error> {
    return Future { promise in
        do {
            let jsonData = try JSONEncoder().encode(book)
            promise(.success(jsonData))
        } catch {
            promise(.failure(error))
        }
    }
}

let book = Book(title: "The Catcher in the Rye", author: "J.D. Salinger", year: 1951)
let jsonPublisher = encodeBook(book: book)

jsonPublisher
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
        // Handle completion
    }, receiveValue: { jsonData in
        // Handle encoded JSON data
    })
```

In the `encodeBook` function, we create a `Future` publisher that encodes the given `Book` instance into JSON data. If successful, we receive the encoded JSON data in the `receiveValue` closure.

## Step 4: Decode JSON Data

To decode JSON data into instances of your `Codable` model, you can use the `JSONDecoder` class. Here's an example of how to decode JSON data into a `Book` instance:

```swift
func decodeBook(jsonData: Data) -> Future<Book, Error> {
    return Future { promise in
        do {
            let book = try JSONDecoder().decode(Book.self, from: jsonData)
            promise(.success(book))
        } catch {
            promise(.failure(error))
        }
    }
}

let jsonData = // JSON data received from an API or file
let bookPublisher = decodeBook(jsonData: jsonData)

bookPublisher
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
        // Handle completion
    }, receiveValue: { book in
        // Handle decoded Book instance
    })
```

In the `decodeBook` function, we create a `Future` publisher that decodes the given JSON data into a `Book` instance. If successful, we receive the decoded `Book` instance in the `receiveValue` closure.

## Conclusion

Integrating the `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` classes with the Combine framework allows us to work with JSON data in a more reactive and streamlined manner. By leveraging the power of Combine, we can easily encode and decode JSON data, handle errors, and work with asynchronous tasks seamlessly.
