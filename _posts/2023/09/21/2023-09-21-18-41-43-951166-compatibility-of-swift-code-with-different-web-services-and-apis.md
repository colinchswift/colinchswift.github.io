When it comes to compatibility, Swift offers great flexibility, allowing developers to work with a wide range of web services and APIs. Here are a few examples of how Swift code can be used to integrate with different web services:

### 1. RESTful APIs:
REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs are widely used for building web services. With Swift, you can easily consume RESTful APIs by making HTTP requests and handling responses.
```swift
import Foundation

// Create a URL request
guard let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/endpoint") else { return }
var request = URLRequest(url: url)
request.httpMethod = "GET"

// Send the request
let session = URLSession.shared
let task = session.dataTask(with: request) { (data, response, error) in
    if let error = error {
        print("Error: \(error)")
    } else if let data = data {
        // Parse the response data
        let responseString = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)
        print("Response: \(responseString)")
    }
}
task.resume()
```

### 2. OAuth and Authentication:
OAuth is commonly used for authentication and authorization in web APIs. Swift libraries such as Alamofire and OAuthSwift provide convenient methods to handle OAuth authentication flows.
```swift
import Alamofire
import OAuthSwift

// Initialize an OAuthSwift client
let oauthswift = OAuth2Swift(
    consumerKey: "your_consumer_key",
    consumerSecret: "your_consumer_secret",
    authorizeUrl: "https://api.example.com/oauth/authorize",
    accessTokenUrl: "https://api.example.com/oauth/token",
    responseType: "code"
)

// Perform OAuth authorization
oauthswift.authorize(
    withCallbackURL: URL(string: "your_callback_url")!,
    scope: "read write",
    state: "your_state") { (result) in
        switch result {
        case .success(let (_, _, parameters)):
            // Use the obtained access token
            let accessToken = parameters["access_token"]
            print("Access token: \(accessToken)")
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
}
```

### 3. SOAP APIs:
Although SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) APIs are less common nowadays, Swift can still be used to interact with them. You can leverage third-party libraries such as Alamofire-SOAP to handle SOAP requests and responses.
```swift
import Alamofire
import Alamofire_SOAP

// Create an Alamofire SOAP manager
let soapManager = AlamofireSoaps()

// Perform a SOAP request
let parameters: [String: Any] = [
    "parameter1": "value1",
    "parameter2": "value2"
]

soapManager.callWebService(
    "https://api.example.com/soap",
    method: "POST",
    soapAction: "https://api.example.com/SoapAction",
    parameters: parameters) { (xml, error) in
        if let error = error {
            print("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        } else if let xml = xml {
            // Parse the XML response
            print("Response: \(xml)")
        }
}

These are just a few examples showcasing how Swift can be used to interact with web services and APIs. The compatibility of Swift with different services and APIs is broad, and developers have the flexibility to integrate with various ecosystems using Swift as their language of choice.
