Enums in Swift are powerful constructs that allow you to define a group of related values. They can also conform to one or more protocols to enhance their functionality. In some cases, you may need to extract the protocols implemented by an enum at runtime. In this blog post, we will explore how to achieve this using the Swift Mirror API.

## What is the Swift Mirror API?

Swift provides a Mirror struct that allows for introspection of the structure and contents of a type. It is particularly useful for examining the properties, methods, and protocols implemented by a type at runtime. By leveraging the Mirror API, we can extract the protocols implemented by an enum.

## Example Scenario

Let's assume that we have an enum called `Vehicle`, which represents different types of vehicles, and it conforms to the `Equatable` and `CustomStringConvertible` protocols. We want to programatically determine the protocols implemented by this enum.

```swift
enum Vehicle: Equatable, CustomStringConvertible {
    case car
    case motorcycle
    case bicycle

    var description: String {
        switch self {
        case .car:
            return "This is a car"
        case .motorcycle:
            return "This is a motorcycle"
        case .bicycle:
            return "This is a bicycle"
        }
    }
}
```

## Extracting Protocols using the Mirror API

To extract the protocols implemented by the `Vehicle` enum, we can make use of the `Mirror` struct and its `children` property. The `children` property returns a collection of `Mirror.Child` instances, where each `Child` represents a member of the enum.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to extract the protocols implemented by an enum:

```swift
let vehicleMirror = Mirror(reflecting: Vehicle.car)
let protocols = vehicleMirror.subjectType as? AnyProtocol.Type

if let protocols = protocols {
    for p in protocols {
        print(p)
    }
}
```

In the above code snippet, we create a `Mirror` instance using the `reflecting` constructor, passing in an instance of one of the enum cases. We then extract the `subjectType`, which represents the type of the enum. By casting the `subjectType` as `AnyProtocol.Type`, we can determine the protocols implemented by the enum.

Finally, we iterate over the protocols and print their names. In this case, the output would be:

```
Equatable
CustomStringConvertible
```

## Conclusion

Using the Swift Mirror API, we can dynamically extract the protocols implemented by an enum. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to discover and work with the protocols conforming to a particular enum in your code. By leveraging the power of Swift's reflection capabilities, you can create more flexible and dynamic code.
