When working with structs in Swift, it can sometimes be useful to inspect their type methods dynamically. The Swift programming language provides a powerful reflection API called `Mirror` that allows us to examine the structure and properties of types at runtime.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use the `Mirror` API to inspect the type methods of a struct. Let's dive in!

## Basic Struct Definition

Let's start by defining a simple struct called `Person` with some type methods:

```swift
struct Person {
    static func greet() {
        print("Hello, I'm a person!")
    }
    
    static func walk() {
        print("I'm walking...")
    }
    
    static func sleep() {
        print("Zzzzz...")
    }
}
```

## Inspecting Type Methods

To inspect the type methods of a struct, we need to create an instance of `Mirror` by passing the type of the struct as a parameter. We can then iterate over the `Mirror` using its `children` property to access the type methods.

```swift
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: Person.self)

for child in mirror.children {
    if let method = child.value as? () -> Void {
        print("\(child.label ?? "") - \(String(describing: method))")
    }
}
```

Running the above code will output the following:

```
greet() - (Function)
walk() - (Function)
sleep() - (Function)
```

As you can see, we successfully accessed the type methods of the `Person` struct using the `Mirror` API. We looped over the `children` property, checked if each child was a method, and printed its name and type.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to inspect the type methods of a struct using the Swift `Mirror` API. By leveraging the power of reflection, we were able to dynamically access and display the type methods of the struct at runtime.

The `Mirror` API opens up exciting possibilities for introspection and runtime manipulation of Swift types. It can be especially useful in scenarios where you need to work with types dynamically, such as building frameworks or writing code generation tools.
