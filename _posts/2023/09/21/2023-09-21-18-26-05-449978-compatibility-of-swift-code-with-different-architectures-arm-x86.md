When developing software, it is important to consider the compatibility of code with different architectures. Swift, the programming language developed by Apple, is designed to be versatile and compatible with various architectures, including ARM and x86.

## ARM Architecture

ARM is a popular architecture used in many mobile devices, such as iPhones and iPads. Swift is fully compatible with ARM-based systems and has been optimized to run efficiently on these devices. You can write Swift code targeting ARM architecture without any special considerations.

## x86 Architecture

x86 is a widely used architecture in desktop and server environments. Swift is also compatible with x86-based systems, allowing developers to write code for platforms such as macOS and Linux. Whether you are developing desktop applications or server-side code, Swift provides excellent compatibility and performance on x86 architectures.

## Cross-Platform Development

Swift's compatibility with both ARM and x86 architectures makes it suitable for cross-platform development. With Swift, you can write code that runs on different platforms without the need for significant modifications. This allows you to leverage the same codebase to develop applications for iOS, macOS, and Linux.

## Code Examples

Here are a few code examples that demonstrate the portability of Swift code across different architectures:

```swift
// Example 1: ARM architecture
let mobileDevice = "iPhone"
if mobileDevice == "iPhone" {
    print("Running on ARM architecture")
}

// Example 2: x86 architecture
let desktopComputer = "Mac"
if desktopComputer == "Mac" {
    print("Running on x86 architecture")
}
```

These examples illustrate how you can write Swift code that seamlessly runs on ARM and x86 architectures. Whether you are targeting mobile devices or desktop systems, Swift provides a consistent and compatible development experience.

Remember, Swift's compatibility with different architectures allows you to write code that is suitable for a wide range of platforms, making it a versatile choice for software development.
