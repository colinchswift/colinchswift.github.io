In Swift, the Mirror API is a powerful tool for inspecting the metadata and the structure of a type at runtime. This can be especially useful when working with enums and wanting to access their associated values and metadata.

To access the type metadata of an enum using the Mirror API, we can follow these steps:

1. Define the enum:

```swift
enum Fruit {
    case apple(count: Int)
    case banana(weight: Double)
    case orange(color: String)
}
```

2. Create an instance of the enum:


```swift
let fruit: Fruit = .apple(count: 5)
```

3. Use the `Mirror(reflecting:)` initializer to create a mirror object that reflects the enum instance:

```swift
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: fruit)
```

4. Iterate through the children of the mirror:

```swift
for child in mirror.children {
    // Access the child properties
    // Child.label contains the case name
    // Child.value contains the associated value
    
    if let label = child.label {
        // Print the case name
        print("Case: \(label)")
    }
    
    // Check if the child value is an associated value
    if let associatedValue = child.value as? Any {
        // Print the associated value
        print("Associated Value: \(associatedValue)")
    }
}
```

This will output:

```
Case: apple
Associated Value: 5
```

By using the Mirror API, we can access the type metadata of enums, iterate through their associated values, and perform operations programmatically based on the enum's structure. This can be particularly useful when dealing with nested enum cases or when dynamically inspecting enums at runtime.
