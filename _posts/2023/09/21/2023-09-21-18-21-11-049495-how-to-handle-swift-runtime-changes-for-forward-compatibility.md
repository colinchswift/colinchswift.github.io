As a developer, keeping your code forward compatible is essential to ensure that your Swift applications continue to run smoothly on future versions of the language. Swift, being a rapidly evolving language, introduces runtime changes with each new version. In this blog post, we will explore some strategies to handle Swift runtime changes and ensure forward compatibility.

## 1. Swift Feature Availability Checking

One way to handle runtime changes is by utilizing the available APIs for checking the availability of certain features or behavior in different versions of Swift. This can be achieved using the `#available` compiler directive, introduced in Swift 2.0.

```swift
if #available(iOS 14, *) {
    // Code that is only executed on iOS 14 and above
} else {
    // Fallback code for earlier iOS versions
}
```

By using `#available`, you can conditionally execute code based on the version of Swift or the availability of specific APIs. This allows you to provide fallback code for earlier versions or take advantage of new features in newer versions.

## 2. Conditional Compilation

Swift also provides conditional compilation directives that allow you to conditionally include or exclude code based on certain conditions. These directives are particularly useful when you need to handle features that are only available in specific versions of Swift.

```swift
#if swift(>=5.0)
    // Code that is only compiled on Swift 5.0 and above
#elseif swift(>=4.2)
    // Code that is only compiled on Swift 4.2 and above
#else
    // Fallback code for earlier Swift versions
#endif
```

Using `#if`, `#elseif`, and `#else` directives, you can write code that is only compiled for specific Swift versions. This allows you to address runtime changes and ensure compatibility across different Swift language versions.

## Conclusion

Handling Swift runtime changes is crucial to maintain forward compatibility in your applications. By leveraging Swift feature availability checking and conditional compilation, you can write code that adapts to different Swift versions and ensures a smooth transition as the language evolves.

With these strategies in place, you can confidently develop Swift applications that will continue to function correctly on future versions of the language.
