One of the powerful features of Swift is the ability to introspect and reflect on the type information of objects at runtime using the Mirror API. Using the Mirror API, we can examine the structure of a particular object, including its properties, methods, and protocols it conforms to.

In this blog post, we will focus on how to use the Mirror API to extract the protocols adopted by a struct in Swift. This can be particularly useful when you need to examine the behavior or characteristics of a struct dynamically.

## Getting Started
To begin, make sure you have a basic understanding of Swift and its syntax. You should also have Xcode or a Swift playground set up to follow along with the examples in this article.

## Using the Mirror API
The starting point for reflecting on an object is to create a `Mirror` instance using the `Mirror(reflecting:)` initializer. Let's consider a simple example where we have a struct called `Person` that adopts multiple protocols:

```swift
struct Person: Codable, Equatable {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
}
```

To extract the protocols adopted by this struct, we can use the following code:

```swift
let person = Person(name: "John Doe", age: 30)
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: person)

for child in mirror.children {
    if let displayStyle = child.value as? DisplayStyle {
        print(displayStyle)
    }
}

```

We first create an instance of the `Person` struct and then create a `Mirror` instance using the `reflecting:` initializer. This allows us to introspect the properties and protocols associated with the `person` object.

In the loop, we iterate over the `children` property of the `Mirror` instance and check if each child conforms to a protocol called `DisplayStyle`. If it does, we print out the name of the protocol.

## Conclusion
By leveraging the Mirror API, we can dynamically extract the protocols adopted by a struct in Swift. This can be useful in cases where we need to introspect the behavior of a struct at runtime. Remember to consult the official Swift documentation for more details on the Mirror API and its capabilities.
