When working with Swift, there may be times when you need to determine the type of an object programmatically. One way to accomplish this is by utilizing the `displayStyle` property of the `Mirror` type. In this blog post, we will explore how to use this property to determine the type of an object in Swift.

## What is the `Mirror` Type?

The `Mirror` type is an important tool in Swift that provides a way to represent the structure and textual representation of any object. It is often used for purposes such as object introspection, debugging, and serialization. By using the `Mirror` type, we can gain access to the properties, associated values, and the general structure of an object.

## Retrieving the Display Style

The `displayStyle` property of a `Mirror` instance provides information about the general type of the object it represents. It is of type `Mirror.DisplayStyle`, which is an enumeration that defines different display styles such as `class`, `struct`, `enum`, `optional`, and more.

To determine the display style of an object, we first need to create a mirror for the object. Let's say we have an instance of a `Person` struct as follows:

```swift
struct Person {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
}

let johnDoe = Person(name: "John Doe", age: 30)
```

We can create a mirror for `johnDoe` using the `Mirror(reflecting:)` initializer:

```swift
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: johnDoe)
```

Now, we can access the `displayStyle` property of the mirror to determine the type of `johnDoe`:

```swift
let displayStyle = mirror.displayStyle

switch displayStyle {
case .class:
    print("The object is of class type")
case .struct:
    print("The object is of struct type")
case .enum:
    print("The object is of enum type")
default:
    print("The object type cannot be determined")
}
```

In this example, since `johnDoe` is an instance of a struct, the output will be "The object is of struct type".

## Conclusion

By using the `displayStyle` property of Swift `Mirror`, we can easily determine the type of an object at runtime. This capability can be particularly useful in scenarios where you need to dynamically handle different types of objects in your code. So, next time you find yourself needing to determine the type of an object, remember to utilize the power of `Mirror`.
