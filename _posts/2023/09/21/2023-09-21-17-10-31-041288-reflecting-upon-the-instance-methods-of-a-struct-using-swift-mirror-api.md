When working with Swift, the Mirror API allows you to inspect the structure and contents of a type, including its properties and methods. It can be particularly useful when you want to reflect upon the instance methods of a struct.

To reflect upon the instance methods of a struct, you can follow these steps:

1. Define your struct with its instance methods. For example, let's create a `Person` struct with two instance methods: `greet()` and `introduce()`.

```swift
struct Person {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
    
    func greet() {
        print("Hello, my name is \(name)!")
    }
    
    func introduce() {
        print("I am \(name) and I am \(age) years old.")
    }
}
```

2. Create an instance of the struct.

```swift
let person = Person(name: "John", age: 30)
```

3. Use the `Mirror` API to reflect upon the instance methods. Get the `children` property of the mirror, filter the elements to select only the methods, and print their names.

```swift
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: person)

for child in mirror.children {
    if let methodName = child.label, let _ = child.value as? () -> Void {
        print("Instance method: \(methodName)")
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Mirror(reflecting:)` initializer is used to create a mirror instance reflecting upon the `Person` struct. The `children` property of the mirror provides an array of `Mirror.Child` instances, which represent the members of the reflected instance.

By filtering the mirror's children to include only those with a closure type (`() -> Void`), we can identify the instance methods. Finally, we print the names of the instance methods to the console.

By following these steps, you can reflect upon the instance methods of a struct in Swift. This can be helpful in scenarios where you need to introspect the structure of your types dynamically. Use this technique to enhance the flexibility and versatility of your Swift codebase.
