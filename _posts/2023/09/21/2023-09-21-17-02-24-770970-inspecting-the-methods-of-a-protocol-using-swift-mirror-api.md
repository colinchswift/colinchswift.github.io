When working with protocols in Swift, it can sometimes be useful to inspect the methods that are defined within them. Swift provides the Mirror API, which allows us to perform runtime introspection of objects, including protocols.

The Mirror API provides a way to access the structural and runtime information of objects, including their properties, methods, and other characteristics. To inspect the methods of a protocol using the Mirror API, we can follow these steps:

1. Define a protocol: Let's start by defining a simple protocol with some methods.

    ```swift
    protocol MyProtocol {
        func method1()
        func method2()
    }
    ```

2. Create an instance that conforms to the protocol: Now, we need to create an instance of a class or struct that conforms to the protocol.

    ```swift
    struct MyStruct: MyProtocol {
        func method1() {
            print("Method 1")
        }
        
        func method2() {
            print("Method 2")
        }
    }
    ```

3. Use the Mirror API to inspect the protocol methods: We can use the `Mirror(reflecting:)` initializer to create a `Mirror` instance that reflects our protocol instance. Then, we can iterate over the `Mirror` to access the methods.

    ```swift
    let myInstance = MyStruct()
    let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: myInstance)
    
    for child in mirror.children {
        if let method = child.value as? () -> Void {
            print("Method: \(child.label ?? "")")
        }
    }
    ```

   In the above code, we iterate over the `children` property of the `Mirror` instance and check if each child is of type `() -> Void`, which is the type of a function that takes no arguments and returns nothing. If it is, we print out the name of the method.

   Output:
   ```
   Method: method1
   Method: method2
   ```

   The above output shows that we successfully iterated over the protocol methods and printed their names.

By using the Swift Mirror API, we can programmatically inspect and access the methods defined in a protocol. This enables us to perform dynamic behavior based on the presence of specific methods within a protocol, providing flexibility and extensibility to our code.
