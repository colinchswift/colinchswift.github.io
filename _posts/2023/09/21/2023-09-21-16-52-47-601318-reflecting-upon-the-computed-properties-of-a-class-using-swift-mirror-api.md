As Swift developers, we often find ourselves needing to inspect and introspect the properties of a class or structure at runtime. This kind of reflection can be particularly useful when working with frameworks or libraries that rely on dynamic behavior.

One common scenario is when we want to retrieve information about the computed properties of a class. In Swift, computed properties are properties that don't store a value directly but provide a getter and optionally a setter to compute their value. For example:

```swift
class Person {
    var name: String
    var age: Int

    var fullName: String {
        return "\(name)"
    }

    init(name: String, age: Int) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    }
}
```

In this example, the `fullName` property is a computed property that returns a formatted string combining the `name` property. 

To reflect upon the computed properties of a class, we can use the Mirror API provided by the Swift standard library. The Mirror API allows us to inspect the structure and properties of a given instance.

Here's an example of how we can use the Mirror API to get the names and types of the computed properties of the `Person` class:

```swift
func getComputedProperties(of instance: Any) -> [(name: String, type: Any.Type)] {
    let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: instance)
    var computedProperties: [(name: String, type: Any.Type)] = []
    
    for child in mirror.children {
        if child.value is String {
            if let childMirror = Mirror(reflecting: child.value) as? Mirror {
                if childMirror.displayStyle == .computed {
                    if let propertyName = child.label {
                        computedProperties.append((name: propertyName, type: type(of: child.value)))
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return computedProperties
}

let person = Person(name: "John Doe", age: 30)
let properties = getComputedProperties(of: person)

for property in properties {
    print("Name: \(property.name), Type: \(property.type)")
}
```

The `getComputedProperties(of:)` function takes an instance of any class and uses the Mirror API to iterate over its children properties. For each property, it checks whether the property value is of type `String` and if the property is computed. If both conditions are met, the property name and type are added to the `computedProperties` array.

In this case, running the code will output:

```
Name: fullName, Type: String
```

This example shows how we can leverage the Swift Mirror API to reflect upon the computed properties of a class. By using this approach, we gain the ability to dynamically introspect and work with the properties of a class at runtime.
