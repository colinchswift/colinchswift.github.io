Swift is a powerful programming language used for developing iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications. One of the useful features of Swift is its Mirror API, which allows us to inspect and manipulate the properties of a struct or class at runtime.

In this blog post, we'll explore how to use the Mirror API to extract the label and value of a property in Swift.

## What is the Mirror API?

The Mirror API in Swift provides a way to introspect the structure of a type, including its properties, methods, and other members. It allows us to examine the properties of an instance and access their labels, types, and values dynamically.

## Extracting the label and value of a property

To demonstrate how to extract the label and value of a property using the Mirror API, let's consider the following example:

```swift
struct Person {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
}

let person = Person(name: "John Doe", age: 25)
```

In the above code, we have defined a struct `Person` with two properties: `name` and `age`. We have also created an instance of `Person` named `person`.

Now, let's use the Mirror API to extract the label and value of each property of `person`:

```swift
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: person)
for (label, value) in mirror.children {
    guard let label = label else { continue }
    print("Property: \(label), Value: \(value)")
}
```

In the above code, we create a mirror of the `person` instance using `Mirror(reflecting:)`. We iterate over the `mirror.children` to access each property of `person`. We use optional binding to unwrap the optional `label` and print it along with the `value`.

## Conclusion

The Swift Mirror API provides a powerful way to introspect the properties of a struct or class at runtime. In this blog post, we have learned how to extract the label and value of a property using the Mirror API. This can be useful in scenarios where we want to perform dynamic property access and manipulation in Swift.
