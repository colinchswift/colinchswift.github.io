In Swift, the Mirror API allows us to inspect an instance's structure, including its properties, methods, and the type information. One useful application of this API is to extract the type name of a variable dynamically at runtime.

To extract the type name using the Swift Mirror API, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Create an instance of `Mirror`

First, we need to create an instance of `Mirror` that reflects the variable we want to extract the type name from:

```swift
let myVariable = 42
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: myVariable)
```

In this example, we have a variable `myVariable` of type `Int` that we want to extract the type name from. We create a `Mirror` instance `mirror` by passing `myVariable` to the `Mirror(reflecting:)` initializer.

## Step 2: Extract the type name

Next, we can extract the type name by accessing the `subjectType` property of the `Mirror` instance:

```swift
let typeName = String(describing: mirror.subjectType)
```

Here, we use `String(describing:)` to convert the `subjectType` to a `String` representation. The resulting `typeName` will contain the name of the type as a `String`.

## Putting it all together

Here's the complete example with the code from both steps:

```swift
let myVariable = 42
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: myVariable)
let typeName = String(describing: mirror.subjectType)
print("Variable type: \(typeName)")
```

When we run the code, it will print:

```
Variable type: Int
```

We successfully extracted the type name of the `myVariable` variable using the Swift Mirror API.

## Conclusion

The Mirror API in Swift is a powerful tool for introspecting an instance's properties, methods, and type information. By using the Mirror API, we can dynamically extract the type name of a variable at runtime, providing us with flexibility and enabling us to perform certain tasks that require type information.
