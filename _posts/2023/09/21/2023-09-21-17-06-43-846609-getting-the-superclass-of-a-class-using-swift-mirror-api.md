In Swift, the `Mirror` API provides a powerful way to inspect the structure and properties of different types, including classes. One common task is to retrieve the superclass of a class, which can be useful in various scenarios. In this article, we will explore how to use the `Mirror` API to achieve this.

To get the superclass of a class, we can use the `superClassMirror()` method provided by the `Mirror` class. This method returns an optional `Mirror` instance representing the superclass if it exists, or `nil` otherwise.

Let's consider an example where we have a simple class hierarchy:

```swift
class Animal {
    // Class implementation
}

class Dog: Animal {
    // Class implementation
}

class Retriever: Dog {
    // Class implementation
}
```

Now, let's see how we can use the `Mirror` API to get the superclass of the `Retriever` class:

```swift
let retriever = Retriever()
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: retriever)

if let superclassMirror = mirror.superClassMirror() {
    print("Retriever's superclass: \(superclassMirror.subjectType)") // Output: Dog
} else {
    print("Retriever has no superclass.")
}
```

In the code snippet above, we create an instance of the `Retriever` class and create a mirror using `Mirror(reflecting:)`. We then check if there is a superclass by calling the `superClassMirror()` method. If a superclass exists, we print its `subjectType`, which gives us the type name (`Dog` in this case).

It's important to note that the `Mirror` API performs runtime introspection, so it incurs some runtime overhead. Therefore, it's recommended to use it judiciously and only when needed.

In conclusion, by leveraging the `Mirror` API in Swift, we can easily obtain the superclass of a class. This can be helpful in scenarios where we need to dynamically inspect and manipulate class hierarchies.
