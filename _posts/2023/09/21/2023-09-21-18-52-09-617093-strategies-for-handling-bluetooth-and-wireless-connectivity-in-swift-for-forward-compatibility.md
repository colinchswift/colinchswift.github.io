In the world of mobile development, Bluetooth and wireless connectivity have become integral parts of many applications. As a Swift developer, it's essential to handle these features efficiently and ensure forward compatibility with upcoming iOS releases. Here are some strategies to consider:

## 1. Leverage Core Bluetooth

When it comes to Bluetooth connectivity, Apple's Core Bluetooth framework is your go-to tool. It provides a high-level interface for interacting with Bluetooth devices and services. By using Core Bluetooth, you can scan for nearby Bluetooth devices, connect to them, and exchange data seamlessly.

To get started with Core Bluetooth, import the framework and implement the necessary delegate methods. Here's an example of how to discover nearby devices:

```swift
import CoreBluetooth

class BluetoothManager: NSObject, CBCentralManagerDelegate {

    private var centralManager: CBCentralManager?

    override init() {
        super.init()
        centralManager = CBCentralManager(delegate: self, queue: nil)
    }

    func centralManagerDidUpdateState(_ central: CBCentralManager) {
        if central.state == .poweredOn {
            central.scanForPeripherals(withServices: nil, options: nil)
        }
    }

    func centralManager(_ central: CBCentralManager, didDiscover peripheral: CBPeripheral, advertisementData: [String: Any], rssi RSSI: NSNumber) {
        // Process discovered peripherals
    }
}

let bluetoothManager = BluetoothManager()
```

Remember to handle different cases for the `centralManagerDidUpdateState` method to ensure compatibility across different iOS versions.

## 2. Use Network Reachability

Wireless connectivity can be challenging to handle due to varying network conditions. To ensure your app works seamlessly in different scenarios, take advantage of Apple's Network Reachability feature. This allows you to monitor the network status and react accordingly.

To use Network Reachability, import the SystemConfiguration framework and set up an instance of `SCNetworkReachability` to monitor network changes. Here's an example:

```swift
import SystemConfiguration

class NetworkManager {

    static func isNetworkAvailable() -> Bool {
        var zeroAddress = sockaddr_in()
        zeroAddress.sin_len = UInt8(MemoryLayout.size(ofValue: zeroAddress))
        zeroAddress.sin_family = sa_family_t(AF_INET)

        guard let reachability = SCNetworkReachabilityCreateWithAddress(nil, &zeroAddress) else {
            return false
        }

        var flags = SCNetworkReachabilityFlags()
        SCNetworkReachabilityGetFlags(reachability, &flags)

        let isReachable = flags.contains(.reachable)
        let needsConnection = flags.contains(.connectionRequired)

        return (isReachable && !needsConnection)
    }
}

if NetworkManager.isNetworkAvailable() {
    // Proceed with network-dependent functionality
} else {
    // Display a message indicating no network connectivity
}
```

By incorporating network reachability checks into your code, your app can adapt to different network conditions and provide a better user experience.

### Conclusion

Handling Bluetooth and wireless connectivity in Swift requires careful implementation to ensure forward compatibility. By leveraging Apple's Core Bluetooth framework for Bluetooth-related tasks and using Network Reachability for wireless connectivity, you can build robust and future-proof applications. Adapt these strategies to your specific requirements, and remember to test your app across different iOS versions to ensure compatibility.
