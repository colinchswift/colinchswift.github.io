In Swift, the Mirror API provides a powerful way to introspect and reflect upon the structure and properties of custom types, including structs. While most of the focus is often placed on accessing properties and methods, it is also possible to examine the deinitializer method of a struct using the Mirror API.

The first step is to define a struct with a deinitializer method:

```swift
struct Person {
    var name: String

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
    
    deinit {
        print("Goodbye, \(name)!")
    }
}
```

To reflect upon the struct and access its deinitializer method, we can use the Swift Mirror API:

```swift
let person = Person(name: "John Doe")

let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: person)

for child in mirror.children {
    if let deinitMethod = child.value as? () -> Void, child.label == "deinit" {
        print("Found deinitializer method!")
        deinitMethod()
        break
    }
}
```

In the above code, we create an instance of the `Person` struct and then create a mirror using `Mirror(reflecting:)`. We iterate over the `children` property of the mirror, which represents the properties and methods of the struct. We check if a child has the type `() -> Void`, indicating a deinitializer method, and the label matches "deinit". If it does, we print a message and invoke the deinitializer method.

It's worth noting that accessing the deinitializer method using the Mirror API is primarily for introspection and exploration purposes. In most cases, deinitialization should be handled automatically by ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).

Using the Mirror API to reflect upon the deinitializer method of a struct can be helpful when debugging and understanding the inner workings of your code. However, it should be used judiciously and with caution, as it can be an advanced and specialized technique.
