While Swift provides an easy way to access the raw value of an enum using the `rawValue` property, there may be cases where you want to access the raw value dynamically. Swift's Mirror API comes to the rescue!

The Mirror API allows you to inspect the structure and values of any Swift type, including enums. By accessing the mirror representation of an enum, you can retrieve its raw value at runtime.

To demonstrate this, let's consider an example with an enum representing different colors:

```swift
enum Color: String {
    case red = "FF0000"
    case green = "00FF00"
    case blue = "0000FF"
}

let selectedColor = Color.green

if let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: selectedColor), let rawValue = mirror.descendant("rawValue") as? String {
    print("The raw value of the selected color is: \(rawValue)")
} else {
    print("Failed to retrieve the raw value")
}
```

In the code above, we define an enum `Color` with three cases: red, green, and blue. Each case is associated with a raw value of type `String`. We then assign the `selectedColor` variable to the `Color.green` case.

Using the Mirror API, we create a mirror representation of `selectedColor`. We can then access the `rawValue` by calling the `descendant` function on the mirror, passing in the key `"rawValue"` as a string. We safely cast the result to `String` and print the raw value, which in this case would be `"00FF00"`.

It's important to note that the Mirror API is mainly intended for reflective purposes and should be used sparingly. Accessing the raw value of an enum using the `rawValue` property directly is usually the preferred approach. However, the Mirror API provides a flexible alternative when you need to dynamically retrieve the raw value at runtime.
