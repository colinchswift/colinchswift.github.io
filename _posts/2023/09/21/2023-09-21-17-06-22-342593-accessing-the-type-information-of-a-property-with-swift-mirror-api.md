When working with Swift, it is sometimes necessary to access the type information of a property at runtime. This can be particularly useful when implementing certain reflection or introspection features in your code. Swift provides a powerful `Mirror` API that allows you to access the type information of properties and other elements of a Swift instance. In this blog post, we will explore how to access the type information of a property using the Swift Mirror API.

## Getting Started

To begin, we need to import the `Foundation` framework, which includes the `Mirror` API. Open Xcode and create a new Swift playground. Then import the framework as shown below:

```swift
import Foundation
```

## Accessing Type Information

Next, let's create a simple class with a few properties:

```swift
class Person {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
    var isEmployed: Bool
    
    init(name: String, age: Int, isEmployed: Bool) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.isEmployed = isEmployed
    }
}
```

Now, we can access the type information of the properties using the `Mirror` API. Let's create an instance of the `Person` class and access the property types:

```swift
let person = Person(name: "John Doe", age: 30, isEmployed: true)

let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: person)

for child in mirror.children {
    if let label = child.label {
        let type = type(of: child.value)
        print("\(label): \(type)")
    }
}
```

In the above code, we create a `Mirror` instance by reflecting on the `person` object. We then iterate over the `children` array of the mirror to access the properties. For each property, we print the label (property name) and the type.

## Running the Code

To see the output, run the playground. You should see the type information of each property printed in the console:

```
name: String
age: Int
isEmployed: Bool
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to access the type information of properties using the Swift Mirror API. This can be helpful when implementing reflection or introspection features in your code. The Mirror API provides a convenient way to access metadata about Swift instances at runtime, enabling you to build powerful and flexible applications.
