In Swift, protocols define a blueprint of required methods that a class or struct must adopt. Sometimes, you may need to inspect the type methods defined within a protocol at runtime. This can be useful when building dynamic frameworks or implementing runtime behavior based on the available methods.

Swift provides the `Mirror` API that allows you to get runtime information about the structure and members of a type, including type methods defined within a protocol. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to inspect the type methods of a protocol using the Swift Mirror API.

## Step 1: Define the Protocol

Let's start by defining a protocol with some type methods:

```swift
protocol MyProtocol {
    static func method1()
    static func method2(param: Int) -> String
}
```

## Step 2: Create a Mirror of the Protocol Type

Next, create a `Mirror` instance of the protocol type using the `reflect()` function:

```swift
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: MyProtocol.self)
```

## Step 3: Enumerate the Children

To inspect type methods, we need to iterate over the `Mirror`'s children and filter out only the methods:

```swift
for child in mirror.children {
    guard let methodName = child.label else {
        continue
    }
    
    // Filter only the type methods
    if child.value is Any.Type {
        print("Type method: \(methodName)")
    }
}
```

In the above code, we check if the `child` has a valid label (method name) and then determine if it is a type method by checking the type of its value. If the value is of type `Any.Type`, it indicates a type method.

## Step 4: Test the Code

Let's test the code by inspecting the type methods of our `MyProtocol`:

```swift
protocol MyProtocol {
    static func method1()
    static func method2(param: Int) -> String
}

let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: MyProtocol.self)

for child in mirror.children {
    guard let methodName = child.label else {
        continue
    }
    
    if child.value is Any.Type {
        print("Type method: \(methodName)")
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Being able to inspect the type methods of a protocol at runtime using the Swift Mirror API can be a powerful technique when building dynamic frameworks or implementing runtime behavior based on the available methods. By understanding how to use the Swift Mirror API and filtering out the type methods, you can gain deeper insights into the protocol's structure and perform advanced runtime operations.
