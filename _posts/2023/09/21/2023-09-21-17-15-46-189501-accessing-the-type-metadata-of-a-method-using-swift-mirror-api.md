To access the type metadata of a method, we first need to obtain a mirror representation of the object. Then, we can iterate over its children to find the specific method we are interested in. Let's look at an example:

```swift
class MyClass {
    func myMethod() {
        // Method implementation
    }
}

let object = MyClass()

// Create a mirror for the object
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: object)

// Iterate over the mirror's children to find methods
for child in mirror.children {
    guard let methodName = child.label else {
        continue
    }
    
    // Check if the child is a method
    if let method = child.value as? () -> Void {
        print("Method name: \(methodName)")
        
        // Get the type metadata of the method
        let methodType = type(of: method)
        print("Method type: \(methodType)")
        
        // Access other metadata, such as the parameter types
        let parameterTypes = methodType.parameterTypes
        print("Method parameter types: \(parameterTypes)")
        
        // Access other metadata, such as the return type
        let returnType = methodType.returnType
        print("Method return type: \(returnType)")
    }
}
```

In the above example, we have a simple class `MyClass` with a single method `myMethod`. We create an instance of `MyClass` and then create a mirror for that object using `Mirror(reflecting: ...)`. 

We iterate over the mirror's children to find methods, and for each method child, we access its type metadata using the `type(of: ...)` method. We can then further inspect the metadata to access details such as the parameter types and return type of the method.

Please note that the Mirror API is primarily intended for debugging and reflection purposes and comes with some limitations. It is not recommended to rely heavily on the Mirror API for production code, as it may have performance implications.

In conclusion, the Swift Mirror API provides a powerful way to access the type metadata of a method at runtime. By using the Mirror API, you can dynamically inspect the properties, methods, and other characteristics of an object. This can be particularly useful for implementing advanced runtime behaviors or debugging your code.
