# Accessing the parent mirror of a Swift Mirror using Swift Mirror API

In Swift, the Mirror API provides a powerful mechanism to introspect the structure and values of a given object. It allows us to iterate over the properties of an object and inspect their values at runtime. However, there might be cases where we need to access the parent mirror of a mirror object. In this article, we will explore how to achieve this using the Swift Mirror API.

## The Mirror API

The Mirror API allows us to obtain a mirror representation of any object in Swift. The `Mirror` type provides a set of properties, like `children`, `displayStyle`, and `subjectType`, that give us information about the object being mirrored.

## Accessing the parent of a mirror

To access the parent mirror of a mirror object, we need to understand the hierarchical nature of mirrors. The `Mirror` type has a `superclassMirror` property that provides access to the mirror representation of the superclass. By recursively accessing the `superclassMirror` property, we can traverse up the hierarchy and reach the parent mirror.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to access the parent mirror using the Mirror API:

```swift
func getParentMirror(_ mirror: Mirror) -> Mirror? {
    // Check if the current mirror has a superclass mirror
    if let superclassMirror = mirror.superclassMirror {
        // Recursively call the function with the superclass mirror
        return getParentMirror(superclassMirror)
    }
    // No superclass mirror, we have reached the top-level mirror
    return mirror
}

// Example usage
class Animal {
    var name: String = "Animal"
}

class Dog: Animal {
    var breed: String = "German Shepherd"
}

let dog = Dog()

let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: dog)
let parentMirror = getParentMirror(mirror)

print(parentMirror?.subjectType) // Prints "Animal"
```

In the above example, we define two classes `Animal` and `Dog`, with `Dog` being a subclass of `Animal`. We create an instance of `Dog` and obtain its mirror representation using `Mirror(reflecting:)`. We then call the `getParentMirror` function, passing in the mirror object. This function recursively traverses up the hierarchy until it reaches the top-level mirror, which corresponds to the parent mirror of the original mirror object.

## Conclusion

The Mirror API in Swift provides a powerful way to inspect objects at runtime. By understanding the hierarchical nature of mirrors and utilizing the `superclassMirror` property, we can easily access the parent mirror of a mirror object. This capability is useful in scenarios where we need to traverse the inheritance hierarchy of an object and perform specific operations. Hopefully, this article has provided you with a clear understanding of accessing the parent mirror using the Swift Mirror API.
