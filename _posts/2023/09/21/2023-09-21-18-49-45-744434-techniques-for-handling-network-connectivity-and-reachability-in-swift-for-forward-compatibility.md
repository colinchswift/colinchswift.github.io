In today's fast-paced digital world, ensuring that our apps can handle network connectivity and reachability is crucial. This ensures that our app can adapt to different network conditions and provide a seamless user experience. In this article, we will explore some techniques for handling network connectivity and reachability in Swift, with a focus on forward compatibility.

## Checking Network Availability
To check if a device is connected to the network, we can use the `NetworkReachability` class. This class provides methods to monitor the network state and receive callbacks when the network state changes.

```swift
import Network

let monitor = NWPathMonitor()

monitor.pathUpdateHandler = { path in
    if path.status == .satisfied {
        // Device is connected to the network
        print("Network is available")
    } else {
        // Device is not connected to the network
        print("Network is not available")
    }
}

// Start monitoring the network
let queue = DispatchQueue(label: "NetworkMonitor")
monitor.start(queue: queue)
```

The `NWPathMonitor` class from the `Network` framework allows us to monitor changes to the network path. We can use the `pathUpdateHandler` closure to receive updates whenever the network state changes. Within this closure, we can check the `status` property of the `NWPath` object to determine if the device is connected to the network.

## Handling Reachability Changes
To handle reachability changes, we can use the `NetworkReachability` class along with the `NWPathMonitor`. This allows us to track the reachability state as well as network connectivity changes.

```swift
import Network

let monitor = NWPathMonitor()

monitor.pathUpdateHandler = { path in
    if path.status == .satisfied {
        if path.isExpensive {
            // Device is connected to the network, but it's a expensive connection (e.g. cellular)
            print("Network is available (expensive connection)")
        } else {
            // Device is connected to the network with a non-expensive connection (e.g. Wi-Fi)
            print("Network is available (non-expensive connection)")
        }
    } else {
        // Device is not connected to the network
        print("Network is not available")
    }
}

let queue = DispatchQueue(label: "NetworkMonitor")
monitor.start(queue: queue)
```

In the updated code snippet, we still use the `pathUpdateHandler` closure to receive updates, but now we also check the `isExpensive` property of the `NWPath` object. This allows us to differentiate between expensive and non-expensive network connections, which can help in managing data usage or providing different functionality based on the network type.

## Conclusion
Handling network connectivity and reachability is a fundamental aspect of building robust and user-friendly iOS apps. By using the `NetworkReachability` and `NWPathMonitor` classes from the `Network` framework in Swift, we can efficiently manage network conditions and provide a seamless experience to our users. Ensuring forward compatibility ensures that our app can adapt to potential changes in future iOS updates, making it future-proof.
