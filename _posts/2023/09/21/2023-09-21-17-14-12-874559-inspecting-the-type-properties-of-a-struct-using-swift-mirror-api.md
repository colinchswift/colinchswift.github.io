#### #Swift #Structs

When working with structs in Swift, there are times when you might need to inspect and access their properties dynamically. This can be useful in cases where you want to perform operations based on the type and value of each property.

Thankfully, Swift provides a powerful reflection mechanism called the Mirror API that allows you to examine the structure and values of a particular instance. In this blog post, we will explore how to use the Mirror API to inspect the type properties of a struct.

## Setting Up the Struct

Let's start by defining a struct with a few properties:

```swift
struct Person {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
    let email: String?
}
```

## Inspecting the Struct Properties

To inspect the type properties of a struct, we first need to create an instance of the struct and then use the `Mirror(reflecting:)` initializer to create a mirror object that allows us to access its properties.

```swift
let person = Person(name: "John Doe", age: 30, email: "john.doe@example.com")
let personMirror = Mirror(reflecting: person)
```

Once we have the mirror object, we can iterate over its children to access each property and its value. The `children` property of the mirror object provides an ordered collection of the struct's properties.

```swift
for child in personMirror.children {
    print("Property name: \(child.label ?? "")")
    print("Property value: \(child.value)")
}
```

In the above code, we are using optional chaining (`child.label ?? ""`) to safely access the label of each property in case it is nil. We then print the name and value of each property.

If you run the above code, you will see the following output:

```
Property name: name
Property value: John Doe
Property name: age
Property value: 30
Property name: email
Property value: Optional("john.doe@example.com")
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to use the Swift Mirror API to inspect the type properties of a struct. This can be beneficial when you need to perform operations or validations based on the properties of a struct dynamically. Swift's reflection capabilities provide a powerful tool for introspecting your code and building more flexible solutions.

Using the Mirror API, you can go beyond just inspecting properties and access other important information like the struct's superclass, display style, and more.

Remember, reflection should be used sparingly as it introduces some performance overhead. So make sure to consider the trade-offs before using it extensively in your code.
