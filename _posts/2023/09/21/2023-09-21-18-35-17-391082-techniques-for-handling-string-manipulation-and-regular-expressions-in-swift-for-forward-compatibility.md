In the world of programming, string manipulation and regular expressions play a vital role in many tasks, ranging from data validation to parsing and formatting. Swift, the programming language developed by Apple, offers several powerful techniques to handle these tasks efficiently. In this article, we will explore some techniques for handling string manipulation and regular expressions in Swift, with a focus on forward compatibility.

## String Manipulation in Swift

### Concatenation

Concatenating strings in Swift is straightforward. You can use the `+` operator or the `+=` operator to concatenate two or more strings. Here's an example:

```swift
var firstName = "John"
var lastName = "Doe"
var fullName = firstName + " " + lastName
print(fullName) // Output: John Doe
```

### Substring Extraction

To extract a substring from a larger string, Swift provides the `prefix`, `suffix`, and `range` methods. You can use these methods to extract a specific portion of a string based on its length or index range. Let's see an example:

```swift
let message = "Hello, World!"
let greeting = message.prefix(5) // Extracts the first five characters
let ending = message.suffix(6) // Extracts the last six characters

print(greeting) // Output: Hello
print(ending) // Output: World!
```

### Replacing Substrings

If you need to replace a particular substring within a string, Swift offers the `replacingOccurrences(of:with:)` method. This method allows you to replace all occurrences of a substring with a new value. Here's an example:

```swift
let sentence = "I love cats. Cats are cute."
let modifiedSentence = sentence.replacingOccurrences(of: "cats", with: "dogs")
print(modifiedSentence) // Output: I love dogs. Dogs are cute.
```

## Regular Expressions in Swift

Swift provides regular expression support through the `NSRegularExpression` class, which is a part of the Foundation framework. With this class, you can perform advanced pattern matching and substitution in strings using regular expressions.

### Pattern Matching

To perform pattern matching using regular expressions, you first need to create a regular expression object with the desired pattern. Then, you can use the `matches(in:options:range:)` method to find all matches within a given string. Here's an example:

```swift
import Foundation

let input = "abcdefg1234hijklmn5678"
let pattern = "[0-9]+"
let regex = try! NSRegularExpression(pattern: pattern)
let matches = regex.matches(in: input, options: [], range: NSRange(input.startIndex..., in: input))

for match in matches {
    let matchRange = match.range
    let matchString = String(input[Range(matchRange, in: input)!])
    print("Found match: \(matchString)")
}
```

Output:
```
Found match: 1234
Found match: 5678
```

### Substitution

In addition to pattern matching, you can also use regular expressions for substitution. The `stringByReplacingMatches(in:options:range:withTemplate:)` method allows you to replace matched substrings with a specified template. Here's an example:

```swift
import Foundation

let input = "Hello, {{name}}! Today is {{day}}."
let pattern = "\\{\\{([^}]+)\\}\\}"
let regex = try! NSRegularExpression(pattern: pattern)
let modifiedString = regex.stringByReplacingMatches(in: input, options: [], range: NSRange(input.startIndex..., in: input), withTemplate: "$1")
print(modifiedString)
```

Output:
```
Hello, name! Today is day.
```

## Conclusion

String manipulation and regular expressions are fundamental techniques used in many programming tasks. Swift provides powerful features for handling string manipulation and regular expressions, making it easy to perform operations such as concatenation, substring extraction, substitution, and pattern matching. By utilizing these techniques, you can confidently handle string manipulation and regular expression tasks in Swift with forward compatibility.
