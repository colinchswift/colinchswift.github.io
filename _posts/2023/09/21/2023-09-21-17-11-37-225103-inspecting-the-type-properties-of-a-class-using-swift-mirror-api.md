In Swift, the Mirror API provides a way to inspect the properties of a class or struct at runtime. With Mirror, you can obtain information about the type, value, and structure of properties, enabling you to perform dynamic tasks such as serialization, debugging, or creating generic utilities.

## What is the Mirror API?

The Mirror API is a Swift built-in framework that allows run-time introspection of a class or struct's properties. It provides a way to access type information, including the names and values of properties, as well as the type's superclass, protocols, and associated types.

## Using Mirror to Inspect Type Properties

To demonstrate how to inspect type properties using the Mirror API, let's consider a class called `Person`:

```swift
class Person {
    var name: String
    var age: Int

    init(name: String, age: Int) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    }
}
```

To inspect the properties of the `Person` class at runtime, we can create a mirror using the `Mirror(reflecting:)` initializer:

```swift
let person = Person(name: "John Doe", age: 25)
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: person)

for child in mirror.children {
    if let label = child.label {
        print("Property name: \(label)")
        print("Property value: \(child.value)")
    }
}
```

In the above code, we create an instance of `Person` and then create a mirror using `Mirror(reflecting:)`. We iterate over the `mirror.children` to access each property of the class. We can then retrieve the property name using `child.label` and the property value using `child.value`.

The output of the above code snippet will be:

```
Property name: name
Property value: John Doe
Property name: age
Property value: 25
```

## Conclusion

Using the Swift Mirror API, we can inspect the properties of a class or struct at runtime. This capability enables dynamic introspection, making it possible to build powerful and flexible functionalities in our Swift applications.
