In Swift, the Mirror API allows us to inspect the structure and values of a type. It provides a way to create custom mirrors, allowing us to define how our custom types are represented and accessed in debuggers and introspection tools.

In this blog post, we will explore how to create a custom mirror for a class using the Swift Mirror API. This can be useful when we want to have more control over the debug representation of our class or when we want to customize how the class properties are accessed.

## Understanding the Mirror API

Before diving into creating a custom mirror, let's understand the basics of the Mirror API. The Mirror type represents the internal structure of a type, providing a way to access its properties and other relevant information.

By default, Swift automatically generates a mirror for every type, allowing us to access its properties with the help of reflection. However, in certain scenarios, we may want to customize how our class is reflected or modify the way its properties are accessed.

## Creating a Custom Mirror

To create a custom mirror for a class, we need to conform to the `CustomReflectable` protocol. This protocol requires us to implement a single method called `customMirror()` which returns an instance of `Mirror`.

Here's an example illustrating how to create a custom mirror for a class:

```swift
class Person: CustomReflectable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int

    init(name: String, age: Int) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    }

    var customMirror: Mirror {
        let children: [Mirror.Child] = [
            ("name", name),
            ("age", age),
            // Add more properties here
        ]

        return Mirror(self, children: children)
    }
}
```

In the above example, we have a `Person` class that conforms to `CustomReflectable` protocol. We define the `customMirror` property, which returns a mirror that represents the structure of our class.

Inside the `customMirror` property, we create an array of `Mirror.Child` values, where each child represents a property of our class. The `Mirror.Child` constructor takes two parameters: the label of the property and its value.

Finally, we create a `Mirror` instance by passing the current object and the children array to its initializer, and return it.

## Using the Custom Mirror

Now that we have created a custom mirror for our class, we can use it to access and manipulate the properties of the class.

Here's an example of how we can use the custom mirror to access the properties of the `Person` class:

```swift
let person = Person(name: "John Doe", age: 30)

for (label, value) in Mirror(reflecting: person).children {
    print("Property: \(label ?? "") - Value: \(value)")
}
```

In the above example, we create an instance of `Person` class and then use the `Mirror(reflecting:)` initializer to create a mirror reflecting the properties of the object.

We then iterate over the `children` property of the mirror, which gives us access to each property label and its corresponding value. We print the label and value for each property.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to create a custom mirror for a class using the Swift Mirror API. By conforming to the `CustomReflectable` protocol and implementing the `customMirror()` method, we can have full control over how our class is reflected and accessed.

Creating a custom mirror gives us the flexibility to customize the debug representation of our classes and fine-tune the introspection capabilities of our applications.
