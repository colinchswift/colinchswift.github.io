In Swift, the Mirror API provides a way to examine the values and structure of any instance. This is especially useful when you want to dynamically access and retrieve the label and value of a property at runtime. In this blog post, we will explore how to use the Mirror API to achieve this.

## Step 1: Create a Struct or Class

First, let's create a struct or class that we can use to demonstrate accessing property labels and values. For example, we will create a simple `Person` struct with `name` and `age` properties.

```swift
struct Person {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
}
```

## Step 2: Examining the Properties with Mirror

We can use the `Mirror(reflecting:)` initializer to create a `Mirror` instance that reflects the properties of a given instance. Let's use this to examine the properties of our `Person` struct.

```swift
let person = Person(name: "John Doe", age: 30)

let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: person)

for child in mirror.children {
    if let label = child.label {
        print("Property: \(label), Value: \(child.value)")
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Retrieve Property Label and Value

In the above code, we iterate over the `children` property of the `Mirror` instance to access each property of the `Person` struct. We can then use optional binding to check if the `child` has a label and retrieve its value. Finally, we print the property label and its corresponding value.

The output will be:

```plaintext
Property: name, Value: John Doe
Property: age, Value: 30
```

## Conclusion

Using the Swift Mirror API, we can dynamically access and retrieve the label and value of properties at runtime. This can be useful in situations where we need to inspect and manipulate types and their properties programmatically.
