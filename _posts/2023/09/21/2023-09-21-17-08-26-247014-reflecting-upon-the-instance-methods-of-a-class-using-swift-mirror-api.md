Reflection is a powerful feature of Swift that allows us to inspect and manipulate the structure of types at runtime. One interesting aspect of reflection is the ability to examine the methods of a class or struct using the Mirror API.

The Mirror API provides a way to reflect upon the properties and methods of a type. In this blog post, we will focus specifically on how to use the Mirror API to reflect upon the instance methods of a class.

To get started, we need to create an instance of the `Mirror` type for our desired class. We can do this by passing our class instance to the `Mirror(reflecting:)` initializer.

```swift
let object = MyClass()
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: object)
```

Once we have the mirror instance, we can iterate over its `children` property to access the properties and methods of the class.

```swift
for child in mirror.children {
    if let method = child.value as? () -> Void {
        // Found an instance method
        print(child.label)
    }
}
```

In the code snippet above, we iterate over each child and check if its value is of type `() -> Void`, which corresponds to an instance method with no parameters and no return value. If the condition is true, we print the label of the method.

Note that the Mirror API provides more information about the methods, such as their return types and parameter types. You can explore these properties of the `child` object to obtain further details.

It's important to mention that the Mirror API works best with classes and structs that conform to the `CustomReflectable` protocol. This allows you to customize the reflection behavior for your types by providing a `customMirror` property that returns a `Mirror` instance.

```swift
struct MyStruct: CustomReflectable {
    // ...

    var customMirror: Mirror {
        return Mirror(reflecting: self)
    }
}
```

By implementing the `customMirror` property, you can control which properties and methods are reflected upon for your types.

In conclusion, the Swift Mirror API provides a powerful mechanism for reflecting upon the instance methods of a class. It allows you to inspect the structure of a type at runtime and retrieve valuable information about its methods. With this knowledge, you can write more dynamic and flexible code in Swift.
