In Swift programming, reflection is a powerful tool that allows you to examine the structure and metadata of your code at runtime. The Mirror API is one of the reflection tools provided by Swift, which enables you to access the type metadata, properties, and other details of a given instance.

To access the type metadata of a Swift Mirror using the Swift Mirror API, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the `Swift` module to gain access to the Mirror API:

```swift
import Swift
```

2. Create a mirror instance of the object you want to inspect:

```swift
let myObject = SomeClass()
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: myObject)
```

3. Access the type metadata using the `subjectType` property of the mirror:

```swift
let typeMetadata = mirror.subjectType
```

4. Use the `typeName` property to get the string representation of the type:

```swift
let typeName = String(describing: typeMetadata)
print(typeName) // Output: "SomeClass"
```

Alternatively, you can use the `Mirror` introspection to iterate over the mirror's children and access their type metadata:

```swift
for child in mirror.children {
    let childTypeMetadata = Mirror(reflecting: child.value).subjectType
    let childTypeName = String(describing: childTypeMetadata)
    print(childTypeName)
}
```

By accessing the type metadata, you can dynamically inspect the structure and properties of an object during runtime. This can be useful in various scenarios such as debugging, serialization, and dynamic UI generation.
