To get started, you'll need to import the `Swift` module and create a `Mirror` instance for the variable you want to inspect. Here's an example:

```swift
import Swift

let number = 42
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: number)
```

In this example, we have a variable `number` with the value `42`. We then create a `Mirror` instance using `Mirror(reflecting: number)`.

Once you have the `Mirror` instance, you can access various properties of the variable, including its type. The `Mirror` type provides a property called `subjectType`, which gives you the type of the variable. Here's how you can access it:

```swift
let type = mirror.subjectType
print("The type of the variable is: \(type)")
```

This code will print the type of the `number` variable, which in this case is `Int`. You can use this technique to extract the type of any variable dynamically.

It's worth noting that the `Mirror` API also provides other useful information about the variable, such as its children (in case of a struct or class) or the names and types of its properties. Feel free to explore the `Mirror` documentation for more details.

In the above example, we showed how to use the `Mirror` API in Swift to extract the type of a variable dynamically at runtime. This can be useful in various scenarios where you need to perform type-specific operations or handle different types of inputs.
