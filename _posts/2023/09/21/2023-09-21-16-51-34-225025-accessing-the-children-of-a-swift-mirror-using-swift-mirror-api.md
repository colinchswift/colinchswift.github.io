One of the powerful features of Swift is its reflection capabilities, which allow us to inspect and manipulate objects at runtime. The Swift Mirror API provides a way to access the properties and children of an object using reflection.

Let's say we have a class called `Person` with two properties: `name` and `age`. We can create an instance of this class and access its properties using reflection.

```swift
class Person {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
    
    init(name: String, age: Int) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    }
}
```

To access the properties of an object using the Mirror API, we can use the `reflect()` function, which returns a Mirror instance. This Mirror instance allows us to iterate over the object's properties and children using the `children` property.

```swift
let person = Person(name: "John", age: 30)
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: person)

for child in mirror.children {
    if let propertyName = child.label {
        print("Property: \(propertyName), Value: \(child.value)")
    }
}
```

The `children` property provides an array of `Mirror.Child` instances, where each child represents a property or a child of the object being reflected. By iterating over the `children` array, we can access the properties' labels and values.

In the code snippet above, we iterate over the `children` array and print the label and value of each child. In this case, the output will be:

```
Property: name, Value: John
Property: age, Value: 30
```

Using the Mirror API, we can dynamically inspect and manipulate objects at runtime. This can be particularly useful for tasks like debugging, serialization, or dynamically creating UI based on the properties of an object.
