When working with protocols in Swift, it can be useful to extract the list of protocols that are implemented by another protocol. This can be achieved using the Swift Mirror API, which provides a way to introspect the type and properties of an object.

To extract the protocols implemented by a protocol, we can follow these steps:

## Step 1: Create a type with the protocol you want to inspect

To start, let's define a dummy protocol that we want to extract the implemented protocols from:

```swift
protocol MyProtocol {
    // protocol requirements...
}
```

## Step 2: Get the mirror for the protocol

Next, we need to get a mirror for the protocol using the Swift Mirror API:

```swift
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: MyProtocol.self)
```

## Step 3: Extract the protocols

Once we have the mirror, we can extract the protocols implemented by the protocol using the `children` property of the mirror:

```swift
let protocols = mirror.children.compactMap {
    $0.value as? Protocol
}
```

The `children` property of the mirror gives us a collection of child elements, which includes the protocols implemented by the protocol. We can then use the `compactMap` function to filter out any child elements that are not of type `Protocol`.

## Complete Example:

Here's a complete example using the steps outlined above:

```swift
protocol MyProtocol {
    // protocol requirements...
}

let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: MyProtocol.self)
let protocols = mirror.children.compactMap {
    $0.value as? Protocol
}

for proto in protocols {
    print(proto)
}
```

This example will output the list of protocols implemented by the `MyProtocol` protocol.

## Conclusion

Using the Swift Mirror API, we can easily introspect and extract information about protocols in Swift. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can extract the protocols implemented by a protocol and use this information in your Swift projects.
