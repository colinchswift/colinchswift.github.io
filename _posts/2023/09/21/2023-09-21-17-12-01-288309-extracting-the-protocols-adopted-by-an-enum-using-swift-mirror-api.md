Enums in Swift can adopt protocols to define a set of requirements that a type must conform to. If you have an enum and want to know which protocols it adopts dynamically at runtime, you can use the Swift Mirror API. In this blog post, we will explore how to extract the protocols adopted by an enum using the Mirror API in Swift.

## What is the Swift Mirror API?

The Mirror API in Swift allows you to inspect the properties, methods, and other characteristics of a type at runtime. You can use it to retrieve information about a type's structure, including its properties, superclass, protocols it adopts, and more.

## Enum and Protocols in Swift

An enum in Swift is a type that represents a group of related values. Protocols, on the other hand, define a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that a type must implement.

When an enum adopts a protocol, it means that the enum conforms to the requirements specified by that protocol. 

## Extracting Protocols Adopted by an Enum

To extract the protocols adopted by an enum, you need to use the Swift Mirror API. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to do it:

```swift
enum MyEnum: SomeProtocol, AnotherProtocol {
    case caseOne
    case caseTwo
    // enum cases and other declarations
}

let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: MyEnum.caseOne)
let adoptedProtocols = mirror.subjectType as? Protocols

for protocol in adoptedProtocols {
    print("\(MyEnum.caseOne) adopts \(protocol)")
}
```

In this example, `MyEnum` is an enum that adopts two protocols, `SomeProtocol` and `AnotherProtocol`. We create a mirror object using `Mirror(reflecting:)` and pass in one of the enum cases to inspect its structure. Then, we extract the protocols adopted by accessing the `subjectType` property of the mirror object.

Finally, we iterate through the adopted protocols and print them out. You can modify this code to suit your specific needs, such as performing further actions based on the extracted protocols.

## Conclusion

The Swift Mirror API provides a way to dynamically extract information about a type's structure at runtime. By using the Mirror API, you can easily extract the protocols adopted by an enum and perform actions based on that information. Understanding how to leverage the Mirror API can be beneficial for building flexible and dynamic Swift applications.
