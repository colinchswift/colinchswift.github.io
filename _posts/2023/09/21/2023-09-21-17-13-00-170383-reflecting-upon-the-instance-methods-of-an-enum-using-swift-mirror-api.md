Enums are a powerful feature in Swift that allow you to define a finite set of related values. With the introduction of the Swift Mirror API, you can now perform reflection on enum instances to access their properties and methods dynamically.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use the Swift Mirror API to reflect upon the instance methods of an enum. Let's dive in!

## What is the Swift Mirror API?

The Swift Mirror API provides a way to inspect the structure and metadata of types at runtime. It allows you to access properties, methods, and other members of types dynamically, making it a valuable tool for tasks such as serialization, debugging, and metaprogramming.

## Reflecting upon Enum Instance Methods

To reflect upon the instance methods of an enum, we first need to create a mirror instance for the enum instance we want to inspect. We can do this by calling the `Mirror(reflecting:)` initializer with the enum instance as the argument.

Here's an example of how to reflect upon the instance methods of an enum:

```swift
enum MathOperation {
    case addition
    case subtraction
    case multiplication
    case division

    func performOperation(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int {
        switch self {
        case .addition:
            return a + b
        case .subtraction:
            return a - b
        case .multiplication:
            return a * b
        case .division:
            return a / b
        }
    }
}

let operation = MathOperation.addition
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: operation)

for child in mirror.children {
    guard let label = child.label else { continue }
    if let method = child.value as? ()->() {
        print("Method name: \(label)")
    }
}
```

In this example, we have an enum called `MathOperation` with four cases representing different mathematical operations. Each case has an associated method `performOperation(a:b:)` that takes two integers as input and returns the result.

We first create an instance of `MathOperation` and store it in the constant `operation`. Then, we create a mirror instance `mirror` by calling `Mirror(reflecting:)` with `operation` as the argument.

Next, we iterate over the `children` property of the mirror, which represents the properties and methods of the reflected instance. We check if the child value is a closure (indicating it's a method), and if so, we print its label, which corresponds to the method name.

When you run this code, you will see the names of the instance methods of the `MathOperation` enum printed in the console.

## Conclusion

The Swift Mirror API provides a powerful way to reflect upon the instance methods of an enum and access their metadata dynamically. It opens up interesting possibilities for tasks such as introspection, debugging, and dynamic behavior modification.

By leveraging the Swift Mirror API, you can explore and utilize the capabilities of enums in your Swift projects. Get creative and experiment with the reflective powers of Swift to unlock new possibilities!
