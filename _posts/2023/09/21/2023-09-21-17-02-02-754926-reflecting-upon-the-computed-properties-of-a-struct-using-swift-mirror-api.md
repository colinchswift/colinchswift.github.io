In Swift, the Mirror API allows you to access and inspect the properties of a struct or class at runtime. It provides a way to examine the structure and values of a type, including its properties, methods, and their associated values.

One interesting use case of the Mirror API is to reflect upon the computed properties of a struct. Computed properties are properties that don't have a storage location, but are computed on the fly using other properties or methods.

To demonstrate this, let's consider a simple struct called `Rectangle` that calculates its area based on its width and height:

```swift
struct Rectangle {
    let width: Double
    let height: Double
    
    var area: Double {
        return width * height
    }
}
```

Now, let's reflect upon the computed property `area` to extract some information about it:

```swift
let rectangle = Rectangle(width: 5.0, height: 3.0)
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: rectangle)

for child in mirror.children {
    if child.label == "area" {
        print("Computed property: \(child.label!)")
        print("Value: \(child.value)")
        print("Type: \(type(of: child.value))")
    }
}
```

The code above creates an instance of `Rectangle` and initializes it with some values. Then, it creates a `Mirror` instance using the `reflecting` initializer, passing in the `rectangle` instance.

By iterating over the `children` property of the mirror, we can access information about the properties of the struct. In this case, we check if the label of the child is "area" (matching the computed property name) and print out its label, value, and type.

When you run this code, it will output:

```
Computed property: area
Value: 15.0
Type: Double
```

As you can see, by reflecting upon the struct using the Mirror API, we were able to access and extract information about the computed property `area`.

Using the Swift Mirror API, you can perform various runtime inspections on the structure and properties of a type. This can be useful in cases where you need to dynamically access or modify properties, validate property values, or perform other runtime analysis.
