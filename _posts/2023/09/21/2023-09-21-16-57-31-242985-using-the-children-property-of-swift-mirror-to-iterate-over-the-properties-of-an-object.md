When working with reflection in Swift, the `Mirror` type provides a way to inspect the structure and values of an object. One useful property of `Mirror` is `children`, which represents the properties or key-value pairs of the object.

By utilizing the power of the `children` property, you can easily iterate over the properties of an object and perform operations based on their values. Here's an example of how to use it:

```swift
struct Person {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
    var address: String
}

let john = Person(name: "John Doe", age: 30, address: "123 Main St")

let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: john)

for case let (label?, value) in mirror.children {
    print("\(label): \(value)")
}
```

In this example, we have a `Person` struct with three properties: `name`, `age`, and `address`. We create an instance of `Person` called `john` with some values.

We then create a mirror of `john` using `Mirror(reflecting: john)`. By iterating over the `children` property of the mirror, we can access each property's label (name) and its associated value. If a property has a label, we print it along with its value.

When running the code, you will see the following output:

```
name: John Doe
age: 30
address: 123 Main St
```

By using the `children` property of the `Mirror` type, we can easily iterate over the properties of an object and perform operations based on their values. This enables us to dynamically inspect and manipulate objects at runtime, making reflection a powerful tool in Swift programming.
