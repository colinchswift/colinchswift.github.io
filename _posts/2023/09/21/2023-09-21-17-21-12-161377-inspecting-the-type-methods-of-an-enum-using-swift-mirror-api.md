Enums in Swift are powerful constructs that allow you to define a set of related values. They also support the declaration of methods that operate on those values. However, at times you may need to dynamically inspect an enum's type methods programmatically. In this blog post, we will explore how to use the Swift Mirror API to achieve this.

## What is the Swift Mirror API?

The Swift Mirror API is a powerful tool that provides runtime introspection capabilities. It allows you to explore the structure and properties of Swift types at runtime. By leveraging the Mirror API, you can examine an enum's type methods dynamically.

## Enum Type Methods

Before we dive into inspecting enum type methods, let's quickly review how to declare them. Consider the following example of an enum that represents different geometric shapes:

```swift
enum Shape {
    case rectangle(width: Double, height: Double)
    case circle(radius: Double)
    
    static func numberOfSides() -> Int {
        return 4
    }
    
    static func area(for shape: Shape) -> Double {
        switch shape {
        case let .rectangle(width, height):
            return width * height
        case let .circle(radius):
            return Double.pi * radius * radius
        }
    }
}
```

In the above code snippet, the `Shape` enum has two associated value cases: `rectangle` and `circle`. Additionally, it has two static type methods: `numberOfSides()` and `area(for shape: Shape)`.

## Using Swift Mirror to Inspect Type Methods

To inspect an enum's type methods using the Swift Mirror API, we need to follow these steps:

1. Create a mirror for the enum instance.
2. Iterate over the children of the mirror, filtering by method executions.
3. Access the `label` property of each child to get the name of the type method.

Here's an example of how this can be done using the `Shape` enum we defined earlier:

```swift
let shape = Shape.rectangle(width: 10, height: 5)
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: shape)

for child in mirror.children {
    if child.label == nil {
        if let method = child.value as? () -> Int {
            let methodName = String(describing: method)
            print("Found type method: \(methodName)")
        }
    }
}
```

In the code snippet above, we create a mirror for an instance of the `Shape` enum. Then, we iterate over the children of the mirror and filter out any entries without a label (unlabeled properties and methods). We also ensure that the child value is a closure with a specific signature using type casting. Finally, we print the name of the type method.

When running the above code, you should see the following output:

```
Found type method: Shape.numberOfSides()
Found type method: Shape.area(for:)
```

In this case, we successfully inspected the type methods of the `Shape` enum using the Swift Mirror API.

## Conclusion

The Swift Mirror API provides a powerful and flexible way to introspect Swift types at runtime. By applying the Mirror API, we can conveniently inspect an enum's type methods dynamically. This capability can be particularly useful in scenarios where you need to discover and work with the methods of enums programmatically.
