Documentation plays a crucial role in the development process, helping developers understand how a library, framework, or piece of code works. However, as software and programming languages evolve, it's important to ensure that documentation remains relevant and helpful. In the case of Swift, following best practices can help maintain forward compatibility and improve the overall development experience. Here are some guidelines to consider:

## 1. Use Descriptive and Clear Comments

Comments are an essential part of documenting Swift code. Use descriptive and clear comments that explain the purpose, functionality, and usage of classes, functions, and variables. *Emphasize the important details* and clarify any specific requirements or side effects. This promotes better understanding and reduces potential confusion for future developers.

```swift
// This function calculates the square of a given number.
// - Parameter number: The input number for which the square is calculated.
// - Returns: The square of the input number.
func calculateSquare(_ number: Int) -> Int {
    return number * number
}
```

## 2. Accurate and Up-to-Date Examples

When providing examples in your documentation, it is important to ensure they are accurate, up-to-date, and reflective of any changes made to the code. Outdated examples can mislead developers and cause unnecessary problems. Regularly review your documentation and update any code snippets to reflect the current programming practices.

```swift
// Example usage:
let result = calculateSquare(5)
print(result) // Output: 25
```

## 3. Document Function Signatures and Parameters

Explicitly documenting function signatures and their parameters helps developers understand how to use a particular function correctly. Include information about the data types expected for each parameter, any default values, and what the function returns. Consider using *markdown lists* to highlight and organize this information.

```swift
/// Replicates a given string for the specified number of times.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - string: The string to be replicated.
///   - count: The number of times the string should be replicated.
/// - Returns: A new string with multiple repetitions of the input string.
func replicateString(_ string: String, count: Int) -> String {
    return String(repeating: string, count: count)
}
```

## 4. Annotate API Changes

Swift is a language that continually evolves, introducing changes in syntax, deprecating old features, and introducing new ones. When documenting APIs or libraries, it is important to annotate any significant changes, deprecations, or other compatibility concerns. *Ensure you use appropriate headings* to draw attention to these important updates.

### **Important Note:**
Starting from Swift version 3.0, the `calculateSquare` function has been replaced with the `square` function in the `MathUtils` module. Please update your code accordingly.

## Conclusion

By following these best practices for documentation in Swift, you can ensure that your codebase remains understandable and usable even as the Swift language evolves. Clear comments, accurate examples, explicit function and parameter documentation, and thoughtful annotations for API changes all contribute to maintaining forward compatibility and improving the development experience.
