When working with protocols in Swift, one common requirement is to retrieve the associated types of a given protocol at runtime. Swift's `Mirror` provides a powerful way to introspect types and extract information about their properties, methods, and associated types.

Here's an example of how you can use `Mirror` to retrieve associated types of a protocol in Swift:

```swift
import Swift

protocol MyProtocol {
    associatedtype ValueType
    var value: ValueType { get set }
}

struct MyStruct: MyProtocol {
    var value: String = "Hello"
}

func printAssociatedType<T>(type: T.Type) {
    let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: T.self)
    
    for child in mirror.children {
        if child.label == "ValueType" {
            print("Associated Type: \(child.value)")
        }
    }
}

printAssociatedType(type: MyStruct.self)
```

In the above code, we have defined a protocol called `MyProtocol` with an associated type `ValueType`. We then create a struct `MyStruct` that conforms to `MyProtocol` and sets the associated type to be `String`.

The `printAssociatedType` function takes a type parameter `T` and uses `Mirror` to reflect on the type and extract its associated types. In the `for` loop, we check if the label of the child property is equal to `"ValueType"`, and if so, we print the value of the associated type.

Finally, we invoke `printAssociatedType` passing `MyStruct.self` as the type parameter. This will output the associated type for `MyStruct`, which in this case is `String`.

This example demonstrates how `Mirror` can be used to retrieve the associated types of a protocol at runtime. It's a powerful tool for introspection and can be particularly useful when dealing with generic programming and dynamic behavior.
