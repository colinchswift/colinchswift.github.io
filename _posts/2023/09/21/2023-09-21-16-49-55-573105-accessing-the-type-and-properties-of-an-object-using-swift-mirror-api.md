Swift provides a powerful reflection API called `Mirror` that allows you to access the type and properties of an object at runtime. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to dynamically inspect and manipulate objects, such as serialization, debugging, or building generic functions.

In this blog post, we will learn how to use the `Mirror` API to access and work with the type and properties of an object in Swift.

## Creating a Mirror

To access the properties of an object, we first need to create a `Mirror` instance. We can do this by simply passing the object we want to inspect to the `Mirror(reflecting:)` initializer. Let's consider a simple example:

```swift
struct Person {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
}

let john = Person(name: "John Doe", age: 30)
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: john)
```

Here, we have defined a `Person` struct with two properties: `name` and `age`. We create an instance of `Person` named `john` and then create a `Mirror` instance `mirror` using `Mirror(reflecting:)`.

## Accessing Type Information

You can access the type information of an object through the `Mirror` instance. The `Mirror` has a `subjectType` property that gives you the type of the object being reflected. Let's print the type information of our `john` object:

```swift
print("Type: \(mirror.subjectType)")
```

This will output:

```
Type: Person
```

## Accessing Property Information

To access the properties of an object, the `Mirror` provides a `children` property that returns a collection of `Mirror.Child` instances. Each `Mirror.Child` represents a property of the object.

Let's iterate over the properties of our `john` object and print their names and values:

```swift
for child in mirror.children {
    guard let propertyName = child.label else {
        continue
    }
    print("\(propertyName): \(child.value)")
}
```

This will output:

```
name: John Doe
age: 30
```

By using the `label` property of the `Mirror.Child` instance, we can get the name of each property. The `value` property gives us the value of the property.

## Conclusion

The Swift Mirror API provides a powerful way to access the type and properties of an object at runtime. Whether you need to inspect objects dynamically, debug complex data structures, or build generic functions, the Mirror API can be a valuable tool in your Swift programming toolkit.

Using the examples we covered in this blog post, you should now have a good starting point for accessing and working with object information using the Swift Mirror API.
