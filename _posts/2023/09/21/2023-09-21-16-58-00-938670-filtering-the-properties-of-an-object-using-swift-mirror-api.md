When working with Swift, there may be times when you need to inspect and filter the properties of an object dynamically at runtime. This can be useful in scenarios such as serializing objects or performing custom validation. Swift provides a `Mirror` API that allows us to examine the structure and properties of an object.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use the Swift Mirror API to filter the properties of an object based on specific criteria.

## What is the Swift Mirror API?

The Swift Mirror API provides a way to inspect the structure, properties, and other elements of a Swift object at runtime. It allows us to iterate over the properties of an object and query information about each property, such as its name, type, and value.

## Filtering Properties of an Object

To demonstrate how to filter the properties of an object, let's consider a simple example. Suppose we have a `Person` class with properties `name`, `age`, and `email`:

```swift
class Person {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
    var email: String

    init(name: String, age: Int, email: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.email = email
    }
}
```

We can use the `Mirror` API to filter the properties of a `Person` object based on specific criteria. For example, let's say we want to filter out properties of type `Int`. We can do this by iterating over the properties using `Mirror` and checking if the type of each property is `Int`:

```swift
let person = Person(name: "John Doe", age: 30, email: "john@example.com")
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: person)
let filteredProperties = mirror.children.filter { $0.value is not Int }
```

In the above code, we create a `Mirror` instance by reflecting on the `person` object. We then use the `children` property of the `Mirror` to get a collection of all the properties of the object. We filter this collection using a closure that checks if the type of each property is not `Int`. The resulting filtered properties will contain only the properties that are not of type `Int`.

We can also filter properties based on other criteria, such as property name or value. For example, to filter properties with a specific name, we can modify the filter closure:

```swift
let filteredPropertiesByName = mirror.children.filter { $0.label != "age" }
```

In the above code, we filter out properties with `label` equal to "age". This will give us only the properties with names other than "age".

## Conclusion

The Swift Mirror API provides a powerful way to inspect and filter the properties of an object dynamically at runtime. By using the Mirror API's `children` property and filter function, we can create custom filters based on specific criteria like property type, name, or value.

Using the example code provided in this blog post, you should be able to filter properties of any object and customize the filtering criteria according to your needs.
