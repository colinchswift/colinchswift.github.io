To get started, let's create a simple class called `Person` with a few properties and methods:

```swift
class Person {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
    
    init(name: String, age: Int) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    }
    
    func sayHello() {
        print("Hello, my name is \(name) and I am \(age) years old.")
    }
    
    func introduce() {
        print("Nice to meet you! I'm \(name).")
    }
}
```

Now, let's create an instance of the `Person` class and inspect its methods using the Mirror API:

```swift
let person = Person(name: "John", age: 25)
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: person)

for child in mirror.children {
    if let method = child.value as? () -> Void {
        print("Method: \(child.label ?? "")")
    }
}
```

In the above code, we create an instance of the `Person` class named `person`. Then, we create a mirror using the `Mirror(reflecting:)` initializer and pass in the `person` object. We iterate over the `mirror.children` to access the properties and methods of the object.

Inside the loop, we check if the child value is of type `() -> Void` (a closure taking no arguments and returning void), which indicates a method. We print the label of the child, which represents the name of the method.

When you run the above code, you will see the following output:

```
Method: sayHello()
Method: introduce()
```

As expected, we see the names of the `sayHello()` and `introduce()` methods.

Using the Mirror API, we can gain insights into an object's structure and behavior at runtime. This can be particularly useful when building tools or frameworks that need to work with unknown or dynamically created objects.

In conclusion, the Mirror API in Swift provides a powerful mechanism for inspecting objects at runtime. By leveraging the Mirror API, we can access and analyze an object's properties and methods dynamically, enabling us to build dynamic and flexible applications.
