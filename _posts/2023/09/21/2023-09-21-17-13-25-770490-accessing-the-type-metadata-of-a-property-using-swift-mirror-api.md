The Swift programming language provides a powerful reflection API called `Mirror`, which allows you to inspect the structure and metadata of types at runtime. With the `Mirror` API, you can access the type metadata of a property, which provides information about its type.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use the Swift `Mirror` API to access the type metadata of a property. This can be useful in cases where you need to dynamically work with the type of a property at runtime.

## The Mirror API

The `Mirror` API in Swift allows you to reflect on the structure and contents of a type. It provides information such as the names and types of properties, the kind of the reflected subject, and the ability to iterate over the child properties.

To access the type metadata of a property, we need to create a `Mirror` instance for the object or instance that contains the property we are interested in.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to access the type metadata of a property using the `Mirror` API in Swift:

```swift
struct Person {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
}

let john = Person(name: "John Doe", age: 30)
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: john)

for child in mirror.children {
    if let propertyName = child.label {
        if propertyName == "name" {
            let propertyType = type(of: child.value)
            print("Type of 'name' property: \(propertyType)")
        }
    }
}
```

In the code snippet above, we define a `Person` struct with two properties: `name` and `age`. We then create an instance of `Person` called `john`. 

Next, we create a `Mirror` instance called `mirror` by reflecting on the `john` object. We iterate over the `mirror`'s children properties and check if the property name matches "name". If it does, we use the `type(of:)` function to access the type metadata of the property and print it out.

When you run the above code, it will output:

```
Type of 'name' property: String
```

This shows that we successfully accessed the type metadata of the `name` property, which is of type `String`.

## Conclusion

The Swift Mirror API provides a powerful way to access the type metadata of properties at runtime. It allows you to dynamically work with the types of properties, which can be useful for tasks such as data validation, serialization, or deserialization.

By leveraging the `Mirror` API, you can enhance your Swift applications with runtime introspection capabilities and create more flexible and dynamic code.
