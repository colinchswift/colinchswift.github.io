When working with Swift, there may be situations where you need to inspect the methods of a class at runtime. Swift provides the `Mirror` API that allows you to examine the structure and contents of a type, including its methods.

## Using the Mirror API

To inspect the methods of a class using the Mirror API, follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of the `Mirror` struct by passing the class instance you want to inspect.

   ```swift
   let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: MyClass())
   ```

2. Loop through the `children` property of the `Mirror` instance to access the properties and methods of the class.

   ```swift
   for child in mirror.children {
       if let method = child.value as? () -> Void {
           print("Method name: \(child.label ?? "")")
       }
   }
   ```

   In the above code snippet, we check if the child's value is of type `() -> Void`, which represents a method. We then print the method name using the `label` property.

## Example Usage

Let's say we have a class `MyClass` with three methods: `method1`, `method2`, and `method3`.

```swift
class MyClass {
    func method1() {
        print("Method 1")
    }
    
    func method2() {
        print("Method 2")
    }
    
    func method3() {
        print("Method 3")
    }
}
```

To inspect the methods of this class, we can use the previously mentioned steps:

```swift
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: MyClass())

for child in mirror.children {
    if let method = child.value as? () -> Void {
        print("Method name: \(child.label ?? "")")
    }
}
```

The output will be:

```
Method name: method1
Method name: method2
Method name: method3
```

## Conclusion

Using the Swift Mirror API, you can dynamically inspect the methods of a class at runtime. This can be helpful in scenarios where you need to introspect the class structure or perform runtime analysis.
