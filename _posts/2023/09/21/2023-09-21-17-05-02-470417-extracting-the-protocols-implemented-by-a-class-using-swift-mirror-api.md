When working with Swift, it can be useful to extract and analyze the protocols implemented by a class. The Swift Mirror API provides a convenient way to accomplish this. In this blog post, we will explore how to use the Swift Mirror API to extract protocols from a class.

## Using the Swift Mirror API

The Swift Mirror API allows us to inspect the structure and metadata of objects at runtime. To extract the protocols implemented by a class, we can make use of the `Mirror` type, which represents the structure and elements of a Swift object.

To get started, we need to create a `Mirror` instance reflecting the class we want to analyze. We can do this by initializing the `Mirror` with the targeted class instance. For example:

```swift
class MyClass: SomeProtocol {
    // class implementation
}

let object = MyClass()
let mirror = Mirror(reflecting: object)
```

Once we have the `Mirror` instance, we can iterate through its `children` property to access the components of the class, including protocols. The `children` property represents the properties, methods, and protocols of the class.

To extract the protocols implemented by the class, we can filter the `children` array based on the `value` property's type. When the type is a `Protocol.Type`, it indicates that the current element is a protocol. Here's an example of how to extract the protocols from the class:

```swift
for child in mirror.children {
    if child.value is Protocol.Type {
        let protocolType = child.value as! Protocol.Type
        let protocolName = "\(protocolType)"
        print("Implemented Protocol: \(protocolName)")
    }
}
```

In this example, each protocol implemented by the class is printed to the console. You can customize the logic inside the loop based on your specific needs. For example, you might want to store the protocol names in an array for later use.

## Conclusion

The Swift Mirror API provides a powerful way to extract protocols implemented by a class at runtime. By leveraging the `Mirror` type and filtering the `children` property, we can easily access and analyze the protocols implemented by a Swift class.

Understanding which protocols a class implements is essential when building complex object hierarchies or working with protocols in Swift. The ability to extract this information at runtime can greatly enhance the flexibility and dynamism of your Swift code.
