Encryption and decryption are common tasks in secure software development. In Swift, we can leverage generics to create a reusable and type-safe approach to encryption and decryption. This not only improves code readability but also enhances code maintainability and scalability.

## Generics in Swift

Generics provide a way to write flexible and reusable code by allowing functions and types to work with any data type. With generics, we can define a function or a type without specifying the exact data type it will operate on.

## Generic Functions for Encryption and Decryption

Let's start by creating a generic function for encryption:

```swift
func encrypt<T: Encodable>(_ data: T, using algorithm: EncryptionAlgorithm) throws -> Data {
    let encoder = JSONEncoder()
    let jsonData = try encoder.encode(data)
    // Use the encryption algorithm to encrypt the JSON data and return the result
    return encryptedData
}
```

In the above code, the `encrypt` function takes a generic parameter `T` that must conform to the `Encodable` protocol. This allows us to encrypt any encodable object, such as structs or classes, using the specified encryption algorithm.

Similarly, we can create a generic function for decryption:

```swift
func decrypt<T: Decodable>(_ data: Data, using algorithm: EncryptionAlgorithm) throws -> T {
    // Use the encryption algorithm to decrypt the data
    let decryptedData = decryptedData
    let decoder = JSONDecoder()
    let decryptedObject = try decoder.decode(T.self, from: decryptedData)
    return decryptedObject
}
```

In the above code, the `decrypt` function takes a generic parameter `T` that must conform to the `Decodable` protocol. This allows us to decrypt any decodable object, such as structs or classes, using the specified encryption algorithm.

## Usage Example

Let's see an example of how we can use these generic functions for encryption and decryption:

```swift
struct Person: Codable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
}

let person = Person(name: "John Doe", age: 30)

do {
    let encryptedData = try encrypt(person, using: .AES)
    // Store or transmit the encrypted data
    
    let decryptedPerson: Person = try decrypt(encryptedData, using: .AES)
    print(decryptedPerson)
} catch {
    print("Encryption/decryption error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

In the above example, we create a `Person` struct and encrypt it using the `.AES` encryption algorithm. We then decrypt the encrypted data and print the decrypted person object.

## Summary

Using generics in encryption and decryption allows us to create reusable and type-safe functions that can work with any encodable or decodable data type. By leveraging generics, we can write clean and scalable code, making our encryption and decryption operations more flexible and maintainable.
