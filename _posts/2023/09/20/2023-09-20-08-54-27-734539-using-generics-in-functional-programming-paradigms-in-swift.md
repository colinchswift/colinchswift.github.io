Functional programming is gaining popularity in the Swift community due to its many benefits, such as code reusability and improved readability. One of the powerful features in Swift that supports functional programming is generics. With generics, you can write flexible and reusable code that can work with different types.

## What are Generics?

Generics allow you to write functions, classes, and structures that can work with any type. Instead of specifying the actual type of the data in your code, you can use a placeholder type, known as a type parameter. This type parameter can be used within the implementation of the function or class, and the actual type is determined when the function or class is called or instantiated.

## Using Generics in Functions

In functional programming, functions are first-class citizens. Therefore, leveraging generics in functions is a common practice. Let's take a simple example of a generic function that swaps two values of any type:

```swift
func swap<T>(_ a: inout T, _ b: inout T) {
    let temp = a
    a = b
    b = temp
}
```

In the above example, we define a generic function called `swap` that takes two inout parameters of the same type `T`. The type parameter `T` is defined within angle brackets `<>`. The function then swaps the values of `a` and `b` using a temporary variable `temp`. 

By using generics, we can call this function with any type that supports the `inout` trait. For example:

```swift
var x = 5
var y = 10

swap(&x, &y) // x is now 10, y is now 5

var str1 = "Hello"
var str2 = "World"

swap(&str1, &str2) // str1 is now "World", str2 is now "Hello"
```

## Using Generics in Structures

Structures in Swift can also make use of generics to add flexibility to their implementations. Let's consider a generic stack data structure:

```swift
struct Stack<Element> {
    private var elements: [Element] = []
    
    mutating func push(_ element: Element) {
        elements.append(element)
    }
    
    mutating func pop() -> Element? {
        return elements.popLast()
    }
    
    func isEmpty() -> Bool {
        return elements.isEmpty
    }
}
```

In the above example, we define a generic structure called `Stack` with a type parameter `Element`. This structure holds an array of elements, which can be of any type. The `push` method adds an element to the stack, the `pop` method removes and returns the last element, and the `isEmpty` method checks if the stack is empty.

By using generics, we can create stack instances with different element types, such as Int, String, or even custom types:

```swift
var integerStack = Stack<Int>()
integerStack.push(1)
integerStack.push(2)
integerStack.push(3)

var stringStack = Stack<String>()
stringStack.push("Hello")
stringStack.push("World")

print(integerStack.pop()) // Prints "3"
print(stringStack.pop()) // Prints "World"
```

## Conclusion

Generics are a powerful tool in functional programming paradigms in Swift, allowing for code reusability and flexibility. By using generics in functions and structures, you can write generic code that works with different types, enhancing the power and expressiveness of your Swift programs. #Swift #FunctionalProgramming
