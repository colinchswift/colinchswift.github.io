Generics are a powerful feature in Swift that allow you to write flexible and reusable code. By using generics, you can create functions, classes, and structures that can work with different types, without the need for duplicating code. In this blog post, we will explore some common coding patterns that leverage generics in Swift.

## 1. Generic Functions

Generic functions in Swift are defined using the `<T>` syntax. The `T` represents a placeholder for any type that will be provided when the function is called. This allows the function to work with different types of inputs. Here's an example of a generic function that swaps the values of two variables:

```swift
func swap<T>(_ a: inout T, _ b: inout T) {
    let temp = a
    a = b
    b = temp
}
```

In this example, the function `swap` takes two inout parameters, `a` and `b`, of the same type `T`. The `inout` keyword is used to indicate that the parameters are passed by reference and will be modified. We can now call this function with different types, such as `Int`, `String`, or even custom types.

## 2. Generic Types

In addition to functions, you can also create generic types in Swift. Generic types are useful when you want to define a class or a structure that can work with different types. For example, let's say we want to create a simple `Stack` data structure that can hold any type of element:

```swift
struct Stack<Element> {
    private var elements: [Element] = []
    
    mutating func push(_ element: Element) {
        elements.append(element)
    }
    
    mutating func pop() -> Element? {
        return elements.popLast()
    }
    
    var isEmpty: Bool {
        return elements.isEmpty
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a generic `Stack` structure that takes an `Element` type as a placeholder. This allows us to use the `Stack` type with any type we want. We can create a stack of integers, strings, or any other type of elements.

## Conclusion

Generics are a powerful feature in Swift that enable you to write reusable and flexible code. By using generics, you can create functions and types that work with different types without duplicating code. Understanding and utilizing generics can greatly improve the quality and efficiency of your Swift code.
