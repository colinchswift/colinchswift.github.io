In Swift, protocols are used to define a set of requirements that classes, structs, or enums must conform to. Protocol extensions allow you to extend a protocol and provide default implementations for its methods. One powerful feature of protocol extensions is the ability to use generics, which makes your code more flexible and reusable.

## Declaring a Generic Protocol

To declare a generic protocol, you can simply add a generic type parameter to the protocol declaration. Here's an example:

```swift
protocol Stack {
    associatedtype Element
    
    var isEmpty: Bool { get }
    var top: Element? { get }
    
    mutating func push(_ element: Element)
    mutating func pop() -> Element?
}
```

In the above example, we've declared a protocol named `Stack` with a generic type parameter `Element`. The protocol defines properties for checking if the stack is empty and accessing the top element, as well as methods for pushing and popping elements.

## Extending a Generic Protocol

Now, let's extend the `Stack` protocol with a default implementation for the `isEmpty` property and the `push` method:

```swift
extension Stack {
    var isEmpty: Bool {
        return top == nil
    }
    
    mutating func push(_ element: Element) {
        // Implementation goes here
    }
}
```

In the above extension, we provide a default implementation for the `isEmpty` property using the `top` property. We also provide a placeholder implementation for the `push` method.

## Using Generics in Protocol Extensions

With the protocol extension in place, we can now conform any type to the `Stack` protocol. Let's create a `Stack` implementation for an array:

```swift
struct ArrayStack<T>: Stack {
    private var elements: [T] = []
    
    var top: T? {
        return elements.last
    }
    
    mutating func push(_ element: T) {
        elements.append(element)
    }
    
    mutating func pop() -> T? {
        return elements.popLast()
    }
}
```

In the `ArrayStack` struct, we've used the generic type parameter `T` to store the elements in an array. We've implemented the `top`, `push`, and `pop` methods as required by the `Stack` protocol.

## Conclusion

Generics in protocol extensions provide a powerful way to create flexible and reusable code in Swift. By using generics in protocols, you can define requirements that are not tied to a specific data type, and provide default implementations that can be used by any conforming type.
