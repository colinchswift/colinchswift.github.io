Swift is a powerful and expressive programming language that provides various features to write clean and reusable code. One such feature is the ability to create **generic functions**, which allow us to write functions that operate on different types without sacrificing type safety.

## What are Generic Functions?

Generic functions in Swift enable us to define functions that can work with various types, without specifying the actual type until the function is called. By using generic functions, we can write code that is more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain.

## Syntax of Generic Functions

The syntax of a generic function in Swift involves using angle brackets (`<>`) and a placeholder type name (also known as the type parameter) to represent an unknown type. Here's a basic example:

```swift
func printArray<T>(array: [T]) {
    for element in array {
        print(element)
    }
}
```

In the above code, `T` is a type parameter that represents an unknown type. It can be replaced with any type when the function is called.

## Using Generic Functions

To use a generic function, we simply call it and provide the actual types inside the angle brackets. Here's an example of how to use the `printArray` function:

```swift
let integers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let strings = ["hello", "world"]

printArray(array: integers) // Output: 1 2 3 4 5
printArray(array: strings) // Output: hello world
```

In the above code, we call the `printArray` function twice with different types (`Int` and `String`). The function works seamlessly with both types because it is generic.

## Constraints on Generic Types

Sometimes, we may want to place constraints on the types that can be used with a generic function. For example, we might want a function that works only with types that conform to a specific protocol.

Here's an example of a generic function with a type constraint:

```swift
func isEquatable<T: Equatable>(value1: T, value2: T) -> Bool {
    return value1 == value2
}
```

In the above code, the `T` type parameter is restricted to types that conform to the `Equatable` protocol. This allows us to use the equality operator (`==`) inside the function body.

## Conclusion

Generic functions in Swift are a powerful tool for writing flexible and reusable code. By using type parameters, we can create functions that can work with different types, improving code quality and reducing duplication. Understanding and utilizing generic functions can greatly enhance your Swift programming skills. So go ahead and start leveraging the power of generics in your own code!
