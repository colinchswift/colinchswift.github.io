Generics are a powerful feature in Swift that allow you to write flexible and reusable code. They enable you to write functions, classes, and structures that can work with any type, allowing for type safety and code reusability. One useful aspect of generics in Swift is the ability to leverage type inference, which allows the compiler to automatically infer the type of a generic parameter based on the context.

## Type Inference in Generic Functions

When you define a generic function in Swift, you can omit the type of its generic parameter(s) and rely on type inference to determine the correct type. This makes the function more flexible and easier to use because callers don't need to explicitly specify the generic type.

Here's an example of a generic function that swaps two values using type inference:

```swift
func swapValues<T>(_ a: inout T, _ b: inout T) {
    let temp = a
    a = b
    b = temp
}

var x = 3
var y = 7

swapValues(&x, &y)
print("Swapped values: \(x), \(y)") // Output: Swapped values: 7, 3
```

In the above code, the `swapValues` function is defined with a generic type `T` using angle brackets `<T>`. The type of the parameters `a` and `b` is inferred based on the types of the variables `x` and `y`. The use of the `inout` keyword allows the function to modify the values of its parameters.

## Type Inference in Generic Structs and Classes

In addition to functions, type inference can be applied to generic structs and classes as well. When defining a generic struct or class, you can omit the type of the generic parameter(s) and let the compiler infer it based on the context.

Here's an example of a generic struct that represents a stack using an array:

```swift
struct Stack<Element> {
    private var items = [Element]()
    
    mutating func push(_ item: Element) {
        items.append(item)
    }
    
    mutating func pop() -> Element? {
        return items.popLast()
    }
}

var stack = Stack<Int>() // Type inference infers Element as Int

stack.push(10)
stack.push(20)
stack.push(30)

print(stack.pop()) // Output: Optional(30)
```

In the above code, we define a generic struct `Stack` with a generic parameter `Element`. The type of `Element` is inferred as `Int` when we create an instance of `Stack` using `Stack<Int>()`.

## Conclusion

Type inference in Swift allows you to write more flexible and concise code when using generics. By relying on the compiler to infer the type of generic parameters, you can create reusable code that works with different types without sacrificing type safety. Generics, combined with type inference, significantly enhance the power and efficiency of Swift programming.
