App Groups allow different apps to access a shared container and share data among themselves. This feature is especially useful when you want to share sensitive information like user credentials across your suite of apps.

To start using App Groups, follow the steps below:

Step 1: Enable App Groups in your projects

- Open your Xcode project and select the target app.
- Go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab.
- Click the "+" button under the "App Groups" section and add a new App Group. Make sure to enable it for both the source and target apps that need to share the credentials.

Step 2: Accessing the shared container

In your source app, you need to store the user credentials in a shared container. This container can be accessed by other apps in the same App Group. Here's an example of how to store and retrieve user credentials:

```swift
// Storing user credentials
let sharedContainer = UserDefaults(suiteName: "group.yourAppGroupIdentifier")
sharedContainer?.set(username, forKey: "username")
sharedContainer?.set(password, forKey: "password")

// Retrieving user credentials
let sharedContainer = UserDefaults(suiteName: "group.yourAppGroupIdentifier")
let username = sharedContainer?.string(forKey: "username")
let password = sharedContainer?.string(forKey: "password")
```

Step 3: Retrieving credentials in the target app

To retrieve the shared user credentials in your target app, follow the same code snippet as in Step 2. Make sure to use the same App Group identifier when accessing the shared container.

```swift
// Retrieving user credentials in the target app
let sharedContainer = UserDefaults(suiteName: "group.yourAppGroupIdentifier")
let username = sharedContainer?.string(forKey: "username")
let password = sharedContainer?.string(forKey: "password")
```

By following these steps, you can securely share user credentials between different apps using App Groups in Swift. Remember to properly configure the App Group identifier in both the source and target apps and handle the user credentials securely within your code.
