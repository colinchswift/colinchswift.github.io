Authentication is a crucial part of many apps, and sometimes we may need to share authentication tokens between different apps. One way to achieve this is by using App Groups in Swift. App Groups allow multiple apps developed by the same team to access a shared container and share data between them. In this blog post, we will explore how to share authentication tokens between apps using App Groups in Swift.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have:
- Xcode installed on your machine
- Basic knowledge of Swift programming language

## Setting Up App Groups

To begin with, we need to set up an App Group identifier in our project. Here's how to do it:

1. Open your project in Xcode.
2. Select your target app's project file from the Project Navigator.
3. Go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab.
4. Enable "App Groups" capability.
5. Click the "+" button to add an App Group.
6. Enter a unique identifier for your App Group, such as "group.com.yourcompany.appgroup".
7. Click "Done" to save the changes.

Once the App Group is set up, we can proceed with sharing the authentication token.

## Sharing Authentication Token

To share the authentication token, we will use UserDefaults, which is a simple way to store and retrieve data in iOS. Here's how it can be done:

1. In the app that generates the authentication token, store the token in UserDefaults using the shared App Group identifier:
```swift
let token = "your_token"
UserDefaults(suiteName: "group.com.yourcompany.appgroup")?.set(token, forKey: "authToken")
```

2. In the app that needs to access the shared token, retrieve it from UserDefaults using the same App Group identifier:
```swift
let token = UserDefaults(suiteName: "group.com.yourcompany.appgroup")?.string(forKey: "authToken")
```

That's it! You have successfully shared the authentication token between apps using App Groups in Swift.

## Conclusion

App Groups provide a convenient way to share data between multiple apps. By leveraging App Groups and UserDefaults, we can easily share authentication tokens between apps in Swift. This can be useful in scenarios where multiple apps need to access the same authenticated user data.
