As Swift developers, we often encounter scenarios where we need to serialize and deserialize Swift objects to and from various data formats such as JSON or Plist. Fortunately, Swift provides the Codable protocol which simplifies this process by automatically converting Swift objects to and from a serialized format.

However, when working with dynamically changing properties in Swift objects, the implementation of serialization and deserialization becomes more challenging. In this blog post, we will explore a solution for serializing and deserializing Swift objects with dynamically changing properties using the Codable protocol.

## Understanding Codable

The Codable protocol in Swift is a powerful feature that allows us to convert Swift objects to and from various data formats without manually implementing the serialization and deserialization logic. By conforming to the Codable protocol, we can leverage Swift's built-in support for encoding and decoding our objects.

To make a Swift object codable, we need to ensure that all its properties are also codable. Swift provides two protocols, Encodable and Decodable, which handle the serialization and deserialization processes respectively. The Codable protocol conveniently combines both protocols.

## Dynamically Changing Properties

In some cases, we may have Swift objects with properties that can change dynamically, such as when working with APIs that return different response structures based on certain conditions. These dynamic properties may not be known during compile-time, making it difficult to implement Codable conformance.

To handle dynamically changing properties, we can use a technique called "nested container key encoding" in Swift. This allows us to encode and decode properties dynamically by providing a set of keys and values at runtime.

## Example Implementation

Let's consider an example where we have a Swift object with two dynamically changing properties: `dynamicProperty1` and `dynamicProperty2`. We want to be able to serialize and deserialize this object using Codable.

```swift
struct DynamicObject: Codable {
    var dynamicProperty1: String
    var dynamicProperty2: Int

    private enum CodingKeys: CodingKey {
        case dynamicProperty1
        case dynamicProperty2
    }

    init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        dynamicProperty1 = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .dynamicProperty1)
        dynamicProperty2 = try container.decode(Int.self, forKey: .dynamicProperty2)

        // Handle additional dynamic properties here if required
    }

    func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
        var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        try container.encode(dynamicProperty1, forKey: .dynamicProperty1)
        try container.encode(dynamicProperty2, forKey: .dynamicProperty2)

        // Encode additional dynamic properties here if required
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a `CodingKeys` enum to specify the dynamic properties as coding keys. In the `init(from:)` method, we decode the dynamic properties using the `decode(_:forKey:)` method. Similarly, in the `encode(to:)` method, we encode the dynamic properties using the `encode(_:forKey:)` method.

By implementing the `Codable` protocol and handling the dynamic properties within the `init(from:)` and `encode(to:)` methods, we can now serialize and deserialize Swift objects with dynamically changing properties.

## Conclusion

Serializing and deserializing Swift objects with dynamically changing properties can be challenging, but by leveraging the Codable protocol and nested container key encoding technique, we can overcome this obstacle. The example implementation provided in this blog post illustrates how to handle dynamically changing properties using Codable.

By making our Swift objects codable, we gain the ability to seamlessly convert our objects to and from various data formats, simplifying the process of working with serialization and deserialization in Swift.
