File access is a fundamental aspect of software development, allowing us to read and write data from and to files. In Swift, there are several ways to handle file access, depending on the specific requirements of your application. In this guide, we will explore different approaches and provide code examples for each.

## 1. FileManager

The `FileManager` class in Swift provides a convenient way to work with files and directories. It offers methods to check the existence of a file, create new directories, and move or copy files.

Here's an example of how to check if a file exists using `FileManager`:

```swift
let fileManager = FileManager.default
let filePath = "/path/to/file.txt"

if fileManager.fileExists(atPath: filePath) {
    print("File exists")
} else {
    print("File does not exist")
}
```

## 2. Reading and Writing Files

To read or write data to a file, we can use the `Data` class in combination with `FileManager`. Here's an example of how to write a string to a file:

```swift
let text = "Hello, World!"
let filePath = "/path/to/file.txt"

if let data = text.data(using: .utf8) {
    fileManager.createFile(atPath: filePath, contents: data, attributes: nil)
    print("File written successfully")
} else {
    print("Failed to write file")
}
```

To read the contents of a file, we can use the `Data` class along with `FileManager`. Here's an example of how to read the contents of a file into a string:

```swift
if let fileData = fileManager.contents(atPath: filePath),
    let fileContents = String(data: fileData, encoding: .utf8) {
    print(fileContents)
} else {
    print("Failed to read file")
}
```

## 3. Working with Directories

Swift's `FileManager` also provides methods to work with directories. We can create new directories, delete existing ones, and list the contents of a directory.

To create a new directory, we can use the `createDirectory` method:

```swift
let directoryPath = "/path/to/new_directory"

do {
    try fileManager.createDirectory(atPath: directoryPath, withIntermediateDirectories: true, attributes: nil)
    print("Directory created successfully")
} catch {
    print("Failed to create directory: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

To list the contents of a directory, we can use the `contentsOfDirectory` method:

```swift
do {
    let contents = try fileManager.contentsOfDirectory(atPath: directoryPath)
    for item in contents {
        print(item)
    }
} catch {
    print("Failed to list directory contents: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

## Conclusion

Handling file access is an essential part of many applications. In this guide, we explored the `FileManager` class in Swift, which provides various methods for file and directory manipulation. We also covered reading and writing files, as well as working with directories. By leveraging these techniques, you can efficiently handle file access in your Swift projects.
