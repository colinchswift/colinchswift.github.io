In the world of software development, **JSON**(JavaScript Object Notation) is one of the most commonly used data interchange formats. It is simple, lightweight, and widely supported across programming languages and platforms.

When working with JSON in Swift, the **Codable** protocol provides a convenient and efficient way to convert JSON data into Swift objects and vice versa. Codable was introduced in Swift 4 and combines the functionalities of **Encodable** and **Decodable** protocols into one.

While Codable works great for simple JSON structures, handling more complex JSON structures can be challenging. In this blog post, we will explore some techniques for handling complex JSON structures using Codable.

## Nested Objects and Arrays

In many cases, JSON structures often contain nested objects and arrays. To handle this, we can define nested structs or classes that conform to the Codable protocol. Let's consider an example JSON structure representing a user:

```swift
struct User: Codable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
    let address: Address
    let friends: [User]
}

struct Address: Codable {
    let street: String
    let city: String
    let country: String
}

struct Response: Codable {
    let users: [User]
}
```

In the above example, the `User` structure contains an `Address` object and an array of `User` objects representing the user's friends. By nesting the appropriate structs, we can easily decode and encode the JSON data.

## Customizing the Coding Keys

Sometimes, the JSON keys do not match the property names in our Swift structs. In such cases, we can use the `CodingKeys` enum to provide custom mappings between the JSON keys and property names.

```swift
struct User: Codable {
    let fullName: String
    let userEmail: String
    
    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case fullName = "name"
        case userEmail = "email"
    }
}
```

In the above example, the property `fullName` is mapped to the JSON key "name" and `userEmail` is mapped to the JSON key "email". This allows Codable to automatically decode and encode the JSON data correctly.

## Handling Optional Values

Another challenge when working with JSON is dealing with optional values. JSON data may contain keys that are optional and can be missing. By using optional types in our Swift structs, we can handle this scenario.

```swift
struct User: Codable {
    let id: String
    let username: String
    let email: String?
}
```

In the above example, the `email` field is optional as it might be missing in the JSON. Codable automatically handles the decoding and encoding of optional values, making it easy to work with JSON data that may have missing fields.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to handle complex JSON structures using Codable in Swift. By nesting structs, customizing coding keys, and handling optional values, we can effectively decode and encode JSON data.

Codable simplifies the task of working with JSON, making it easier to consume data from web APIs and integrate it into our Swift applications.
