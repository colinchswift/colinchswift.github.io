Core Animation is a powerful framework in Swift that allows developers to create smooth and visually appealing animations in their iOS apps. However, it's essential to apply proper access control to ensure that animations are performed only when necessary and by authorized code.

Access control is a feature in Swift that enables developers to define the scope and visibility of their code. By enforcing access control rules, you can prevent unauthorized access to Core Animation and enhance the security and performance of your app.

## 1. Private Access Control

The first step in applying access control to Core Animation is to declare your animation properties and methods as private. This restricts access to these components to the current file only.

```swift
private var animationView: UIView!
private var animationDuration: TimeInterval!

private func runAnimation() {
    // Animation code goes here
}
```

By keeping the animation view and duration private, you ensure that only the code within the current file can access and modify them. This prevents accidental misuse or unauthorized changes to the animation parameters.

## 2. Internal Access Control

In some cases, you may need to access Core Animation components from other parts of your app or from different modules. In such scenarios, you can use the internal access control level.

```swift
internal let animationCurve: CAMediaTimingFunction = CAMediaTimingFunction(name: .easeIn)
internal func stopAnimation() {
    // Stop animation code
}
```

By marking the animation curve as internal, you allow other components within your app or module to access and use it. However, external code outside the module is still restricted from accessing it.

## Conclusion

Applying access control to Core Animation in Swift is crucial for maintaining the security and performance of your app. By declaring animation properties and methods as private or internal, you can restrict access to authorized code and prevent unauthorized modifications.

Remember to consistently apply access control throughout your codebase to establish a clear and secure environment for working with Core Animation. This not only protects your animations but also ensures that your app remains stable and reliable.
