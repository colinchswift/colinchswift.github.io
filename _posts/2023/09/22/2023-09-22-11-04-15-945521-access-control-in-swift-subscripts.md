When working with Swift, access control is an essential feature that helps enforce encapsulation and protects the internal state of our objects. Subscripts in Swift allow us to access elements of a collection or list-like object using subscript syntax. In this blog post, we'll explore how to apply access control modifiers to Swift subscripts to control their visibility and usage.

## Private Subscripts

A subscript declared with `private` access control modifier can only be accessed within the same source file where it is defined. This is useful when we want to hide the implementation details of our object and restrict access to it from external sources.

```swift
private subscript(index: Int) -> Int {
    get {
        // implementation details
    }
    set(newValue) {
        // implementation details
    }
}
```

In the code snippet above, the subscript can only be accessed within the same source file. Any attempt to access or modify it from outside the file will result in a compile-time error.

## Internal Subscripts

An `internal` subscript is accessible within the same module, which could be a framework or an application. This is the default access level if we don't specify any access control modifier for our subscript.

```swift
internal subscript(index: Int) -> String {
    get {
        // implementation details
    }
    set(newValue) {
        // implementation details
    }
}
```

The `internal` keyword allows other source files within the same module to access and modify the subscript. However, it prevents access from external modules.

## Public Subscripts

When we want to expose subscripts to other modules, we can use the `public` access control modifier. This allows the subscript to be accessed and modified from anywhere, including external frameworks, modules, and applications.

```swift
public subscript(index: Int) -> Double {
    get {
        // implementation details
    }
    set(newValue) {
        // implementation details
    }
}
```

By declaring a subscript as `public`, we make it visible and usable by other modules. This can be useful when we are building a framework and want to provide a clean and well-documented API for other developers to use.

## Conclusion

Access control in Swift subscripts gives us fine-grained control over the visibility and usage of our collection-like objects. By using access control modifiers like `private`, `internal`, and `public`, we can enforce encapsulation, protect internal details, and expose subscripts to other modules when needed. Understanding and applying the appropriate access control in our code can lead to more maintainable and secure software development.
