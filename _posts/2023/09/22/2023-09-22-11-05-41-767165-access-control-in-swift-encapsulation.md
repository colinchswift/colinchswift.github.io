## What is Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is one of the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It refers to the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class. The main purpose of encapsulation is to hide the internal implementation details of a class and provide a well-defined interface for interacting with the object.

By encapsulating your code, you can prevent unauthorized access or modification of data, reduce dependencies between different parts of your codebase, and improve code maintainability.

## Access Levels in Swift

Swift provides five different access levels to control the visibility of your code entities:

- **Private**: The most restrictive access level, limited to the current declaration scope. Private members are only accessible within the same source file.

- **Fileprivate**: Similar to private, fileprivate allows access to members within the same source file. However, unlike private, fileprivate extends to the entire file, not just the declaration scope.

- **Internal**: This is the default access level in Swift. Internal access allows entities to be accessed within any source file in the same module.

- **Public**: Public access allows entities to be accessed from any source file, within the module or from other modules. However, it does not allow subclassing or overriding of methods and properties.

- **Open**: The highest access level, open provides public access with the added ability to subclass or override methods and properties. Open access is primarily used when creating frameworks or libraries to provide extensibility for users.

## Access Control Examples

Let's take a look at some examples to understand how access control promotes encapsulation in Swift:

### Example 1: Private Access Level

```swift
class Person {
    private var name: String
    
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
    
    func sayHello() {
        print("Hello, my name is \(name)")
    }
}

let person = Person(name: "John")
person.sayHello() // Output: Hello, my name is John
person.name = "David" // Error: 'name' is inaccessible due to 'private' protection level
```

In this example, the `name` property of the `Person` class is marked as private. It can only be accessed within the same scope, which in this case, is within the `Person` class itself. Attempting to access `person.name` outside of the class will result in a compilation error.

### Example 2: Public Access Level

```swift
open class Car {
    public var brand: String
    
    public init(brand: String) {
        self.brand = brand
    }
    
    open func startEngine() {
        print("\(brand) engine started!")
    }
}

let car = Car(brand: "Tesla")
car.startEngine() // Output: Tesla engine started!
car.brand = "BMW" // Accessible as it is declared as public
```

In this example, the `Car` class is declared as open and its properties and methods are marked as public. This allows the class and its members to be accessed freely from anywhere. The `startEngine()` method can be overridden by subclasses and the `brand` property can be modified outside the class.

## Conclusion

Access control in Swift plays a vital role in maintaining encapsulation and data integrity in your codebase. By using the appropriate access levels, you can control visibility, prevent unwanted modifications, and reduce dependencies between different parts of your code. It is important to understand and implement access control correctly to ensure the security and reliability of your Swift-based applications.
