When it comes to documenting APIs, Swagger and OpenAPI are two widely-used specifications that provide a standard way to describe RESTful APIs. These specifications allow developers to generate client SDKs, server stubs, and interactive API documentation. Using `Codable` in Swift, we can easily define the data models for our API endpoints and generate code snippets in Swagger and OpenAPI formats.

## What is Codable?

`Codable` is a protocol introduced in Swift 4 that provides a convenient way to encode and decode data structures to and from different external representations, such as JSON or XML. By conforming to the `Codable` protocol, Swift types can be easily serialized and deserialized without the need for any additional code.

## Generating Swagger and OpenAPI Code Snippets

To generate Swagger and OpenAPI code snippets, we can leverage the power of the `Codable` protocol in Swift. The first step is to define our data models using `Codable`, ensuring that each property in the model conforms to `Codable`. Here's an example:

```swift
struct User: Codable {
  let id: Int
  let name: String
  let email: String
}

struct ApiResponse<T: Codable>: Codable {
  let success: Bool
  let data: T
}
```

In the above example, we define a `User` struct and an `ApiResponse` struct that wraps a generic `data` property. Both of these structs conform to `Codable`.

Next, we need to annotate our API endpoints using annotations that conform to the Swagger and OpenAPI specifications. There are multiple libraries available in Swift that can help with this. One popular library is `SwagGen`, which uses annotations to generate Swagger and OpenAPI specifications. Here's an example of how we can annotate our API endpoints:

```swift
/// Fetches a user by ID
/// - Parameters:
///   - id: The ID of the user to fetch
///   - completion: The completion block with the `ApiResponse<User>`
@GET("/users/{id}")
func getUserByID(
  @Path id: Int,
  completion: @escaping (ApiResponse<User>) -> Void
)
```

Once we have annotated our APIs, we can use `SwagGen` to generate the Swagger and OpenAPI specifications. This can be done either at compile-time or runtime, depending on your needs.

To generate code snippets from the Swagger and OpenAPI specifications, we can use code generation tools such as `Swagger Codegen`. These tools provide templates that allow us to generate client SDKs in various languages using the Swagger or OpenAPI specifications.

By combining the power of `Codable` and Swagger/OpenAPI annotations, we can easily define our data models, document our APIs, and generate code snippets for various platforms and languages.
