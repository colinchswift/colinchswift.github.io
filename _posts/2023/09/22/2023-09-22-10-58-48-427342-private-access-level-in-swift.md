When working with Swift, it is important to understand the concept of access levels. Access levels determine the scope and visibility of classes, properties, methods, and other entities in your code. One of the access levels available in Swift is "private".

## What does "private" mean?

The "private" access level restricts the use of an entity to its own defining scope. This means that a private entity can only be accessed within the same source file where it is declared. It is not available outside the file, even to other types in the same module.

## How to use "private" access level?

To declare a private entity in Swift, simply use the "private" keyword before the entity's declaration. Here's an example:

```swift
private class MyClass {
    private var privateVariable = 10

    private func privateMethod() {
        print("This is a private method.")
    }
}

private enum MyEnum {
    case case1
    case case2
}
```

In the above example, we have declared a private class `MyClass` with a private variable `privateVariable` and a private method `privateMethod`. We have also declared a private enum `MyEnum`. These entities are only accessible within the same source file where they are declared.

## Benefits of using "private" access level

Using the "private" access level in Swift offers several benefits:

1. **Encapsulation**: By marking entities as private, you ensure that they are only accessible to the necessary code within the same file. This promotes encapsulation and helps to hide implementation details.

2. **Enhanced code organization**: By limiting the scope of an entity, you can keep your codebase more organized and manageable. It prevents unnecessary access to entities from other parts of the project.

3. **Code safety**: Limiting the access to certain entities helps prevent unintended modifications or misuses. It ensures that entities are only used as intended, reducing the risk of introducing bugs or breaking changes.

## Conclusion

The "private" access level in Swift allows you to restrict the visibility of entities within the same file. By properly using the "private" access level, you can promote encapsulation, enhance code organization, and ensure code safety. Understanding and applying access levels appropriately is an important aspect of writing clean and maintainable Swift code.
