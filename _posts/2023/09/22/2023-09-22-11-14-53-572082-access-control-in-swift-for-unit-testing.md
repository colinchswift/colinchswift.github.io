When it comes to unit testing, access control becomes even more crucial. You may want to test private or internal methods and properties that are not accessible from outside the module. In this blog post, we will explore different strategies to overcome access control limitations during unit testing in Swift.

## 1. Using @testable

The `@testable` attribute allows you to make internal and private declarations accessible to your unit tests without compromising the access control rules. To do this, follow these steps:

1. In your testing target's build settings, set the `Enable Testability` flag to `Yes`.
2. Import the module that contains the code you want to test using `@testable import MyModule` in your test file.

Here's an example:

```swift
@testable import MyModule

class MyTestClass: XCTestCase {
    func testPrivateMethod() {
        let instance = MyClass()
        let result = instance.privateMethod()

        XCTAssertEqual(result, 42)
    }
}
```

By using `@testable import`, you can now access internal members of `MyModule` including private methods.

## 2. Creating an Extension

Another approach is to create an extension of the targeted class within your test target. This allows you to access its private or internal members without making any changes to the original code. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
@testable import MyModule

extension MyClass {
    func testablePrivateMethod() -> Int {
        return privateMethod()
    }
}

class MyTestClass: XCTestCase {
    func testPrivateMethod() {
        let instance = MyClass()
        let result = instance.testablePrivateMethod()

        XCTAssertEqual(result, 42)
    }
}
```

In this example, an extension of `MyClass` is created in the test target, providing access to the private method `privateMethod()` for test purposes.

By using either of these techniques, you can overcome access control limitations and effectively test private or internal members in Swift.
