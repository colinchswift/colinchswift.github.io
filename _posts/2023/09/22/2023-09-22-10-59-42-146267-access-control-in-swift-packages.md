When developing a Swift package, it is important to have control over the access levels of the code you are exposing. Access control allows you to define which entities (such as classes, structs, enums, and functions) should be accessible from other modules.

## Access Levels in Swift

Swift provides five access levels that can be applied to entities in your code:

1. **Open**: The highest access level. Entities marked as `open` can be subclassed and overridden by entities from other modules.

2. **Public**: Entities marked as `public` are accessible from any other module. However, they cannot be subclassed or overridden outside of their defining module.

3. **Internal**: This is the default access level when no access level modifier is specified. Entities marked as `internal` are accessible from any source file within the same module. They are not accessible from other modules.

4. **File-private**: Entities marked as `fileprivate` are only accessible within the same source file that contains their declaration.

5. **Private**: The most restrictive access level. Entities marked as `private` are only accessible within the enclosing declaration.

## Access Levels in Swift Packages

In Swift packages, the access control rules apply to the entire package. This means that the access level of a package is determined by the access level of its constituent entities.

By default, the access level of a Swift package is set to `internal`, which means that entities within the package are only accessible within the same module. However, you can explicitly specify a different access level for your package using the `@_exported` attribute in the package's manifest file (`Package.swift`).

## Example

Let's say we have a Swift package called "MathUtils" that contains various mathematical utility functions. We want to make some of these functions accessible from other modules, while keeping others limited to internal use within the package.

```swift
// Package.swift

let package = Package(
    name: "MathUtils",
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "MathUtils",
            targets: ["MathUtils"]),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "MathUtils",
            dependencies: [],
            path: "Sources",
            exclude: ["Tests"],
            swiftSettings: [
                .define("ENABLE_EXPORTED_IMPORTS") // Allow access to exported entities
            ]),
    ]
)
```

In this example, the package manifest includes the `swiftSettings` attribute with the `.define("ENABLE_EXPORTED_IMPORTS")` setting. This exposes the package's entities as `public`, allowing them to be accessed from other modules.

To make a specific entity within the package accessible externally, you can mark its access level as `public`. For example:

```swift
// MathUtils.swift

public func add(_ a: Int, _ b: Int) -> Int {
    return a + b
}

internal func multiply(_ a: Int, _ b: Int) -> Int {
    return a * b
}
```

In this case, the `add` function is marked as `public` and can be accessed from any module that imports the "MathUtils" package. The `multiply` function is marked as `internal` and is only accessible within the same module.

## Conclusion

Understanding and appropriately applying access control in Swift packages is crucial for creating modular and reusable code. By setting the access level of your package and its entities, you can control which parts of your code can be accessed from external modules, ensuring encapsulation and maintaining data integrity.
