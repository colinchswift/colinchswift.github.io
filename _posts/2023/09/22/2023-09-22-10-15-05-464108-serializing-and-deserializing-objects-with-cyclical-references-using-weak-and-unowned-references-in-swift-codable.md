One of the key features of the Swift Codable protocol is its ability to serialize and deserialize objects from and to various data formats such as JSON. However, when dealing with objects that have cyclical references, the default behavior of Codable can result in memory leaks or errors.

In Swift, objects with cyclical references occur when two or more objects hold strong references to each other, creating a loop that prevents them from being deallocated. This can lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior in your application.

Fortunately, Swift provides two solutions to handle cyclical references when working with Codable: **weak** and **unowned** references. These references allow objects to hold references to each other without creating a strong reference cycle.

## Using Weak References

Weak references are used when you have a relationship between two objects where one object is the owner and the other is owned. To handle cyclical references with weak references, you can use the `weak` keyword in your Swift code.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use weak references when serializing and deserializing objects with cyclical references using Codable:

```swift
class Person: Codable {
    var name: String
    weak var friend: Person?

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

// Create two Person instances
let john = Person(name: "John")
let david = Person(name: "David")

// Establish a weak reference between john and david
john.friend = david
david.friend = john

// Encode john object to JSON
let encoder = JSONEncoder()
if let data = try? encoder.encode(john),
   let jsonString = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) {
    print(jsonString)
}

// Decode JSON back to objects
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
if let jsonData = jsonString.data(using: .utf8),
   let decodedJohn = try? decoder.decode(Person.self, from: jsonData) {
    // Access the friend property
    if let friend = decodedJohn.friend {
        print(friend.name) // Output: David
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a `Person` class with a `name` property and a weak `friend` property. The `friend` property establishes a weak reference between two `Person` instances. We can then encode the `john` object to JSON and decode it back to an object, accessing the `friend` property to verify that the weak reference is maintained.

## Using Unowned References

Unowned references are used when you have a relationship between two objects where both objects have an equal ownership. To handle cyclical references with unowned references, you can use the `unowned` keyword in your Swift code.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use unowned references when serializing and deserializing objects with cyclical references using Codable:

```swift
class Car: Codable {
    var brand: String
    unowned var owner: Person?

    init(brand: String) {
        self.brand = brand
    }
}

// Create a Car instance
let bmw = Car(brand: "BMW")

// Establish an unowned reference between bmw and john
bmw.owner = john

// Encode bmw object to JSON
let encoder = JSONEncoder()
if let data = try? encoder.encode(bmw),
   let jsonString = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) {
    print(jsonString)
}

// Decode JSON back to objects
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
if let jsonData = jsonString.data(using: .utf8),
   let decodedBmw = try? decoder.decode(Car.self, from: jsonData) {
    // Access the owner property
    if let owner = decodedBmw.owner {
        print(owner.name) // Output: John
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a `Car` class with a `brand` property and an unowned `owner` property, establishing an unowned reference between a `Car` instance and a `Person` instance. We can encode the `bmw` object to JSON and decode it back to an object, accessing the `owner` property to verify that the unowned reference is maintained.

**#Swift #Codable**

By using weak and unowned references, you can handle cyclical references when serializing and deserializing objects in Swift Codable, ensuring memory safety and preventing memory leaks.
