In Swift, access levels are used to control the visibility and accessibility of different elements, such as variables, functions, classes, and modules. The two main access levels in Swift are `public` and `internal`. Understanding the difference between these access levels is crucial for writing modular and maintainable code.

## Internal Access Level

The `internal` access level is the default level for any element that doesn't have an explicit access modifier specified. Elements with internal access level can be accessed from anywhere within the same module but are not accessible outside of the module.

For example, if you have a module named `MyApp` and inside it, you define a class called `MyClass` with an internal access level, other classes or functions within the same module `MyApp` can access and use `MyClass`. However, if you try to access `MyClass` from another module, you will get a compilation error.

```swift
internal class MyClass {
    // Internal class implementation
}

// Accessing MyClass within the same module
let myObject = MyClass()
```

## Public Access Level

The `public` access level is the highest level of access and provides the broadest scope for an element. Elements marked as public can be accessed from anywhere, both within and outside of the module. This allows other modules to import and use the publicly accessible elements.

```swift
public class MyPublicClass {
    // Public class implementation
}

// Accessing MyPublicClass from another module
let myObject = MyPublicClass()
```

It's important to note that if a class or struct has public access level, but it contains members (variables, functions, etc.) with internal access level, those members will still only be accessible within the module. Only the class or struct itself will be accessible from outside the module.

## Choosing the Right Access Level

When designing your codebase, it's essential to choose the appropriate access level for each element to ensure proper encapsulation and maintainability. Here are a few pointers for choosing the right access level:

1. **Use internal access level as a default**: If you don't have a specific reason to expose an element outside of its module, stick with the internal access level to keep your codebase organized and avoid unnecessary dependencies.
2. **Use public access level for frameworks and libraries**: If you are building a reusable framework or library, you should mark the public interfaces, classes, and functions as `public` to allow other modules to use them.
3. **Avoid using public access level excessively**: It's generally not recommended to mark everything as public, as it can lead to a lack of encapsulation and make your codebase harder to maintain. Instead, consider using internal access level for elements that don't need to be publicly accessible.

In conclusion, by understanding the difference between `public` and `internal` access levels in Swift, you can effectively control the visibility and accessibility of your code elements, ensuring proper encapsulation and modular design in your projects.
