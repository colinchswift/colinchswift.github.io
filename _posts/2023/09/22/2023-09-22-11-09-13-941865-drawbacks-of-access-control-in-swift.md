Access control is a powerful feature in Swift that allows developers to specify the visibility and accessibility of code symbols such as classes, methods, properties, and more. While access control provides several benefits, it also has its drawbacks. In this blog post, we will discuss some of the limitations and drawbacks of access control in Swift.

## 1. Increased Complexity

One of the primary drawbacks of access control is the increased complexity it can introduce to the codebase. As developers define access levels for various code symbols, they need to carefully consider how different parts of the application interact with each other.

The complexity arises when dealing with different access levels and their interactions. For example, a method marked as `internal` can potentially be accessed by any code within the same module, which can make it challenging to track down the exact usage and potential side effects.

## 2. Tedious Boilerplate Code

Another drawback of access control in Swift is the potential for generating excessive boilerplate code. When dealing with multiple levels of access control, developers may need to write access modifiers repeatedly throughout the codebase.

For example, if a class has numerous properties and methods with different access levels, developers need to explicitly set the access level for each of them. This can lead to code verbosity and make it harder to maintain and understand the codebase.

## 3. Limitations in Code Reusability

Access control can sometimes limit code reusability, especially when using frameworks or libraries. Swift's access control rules apply at the module level, meaning that you cannot access symbols from a different module if they are not explicitly marked as `public`.

This limitation can be problematic when using third-party libraries or when trying to distribute your library or framework to other developers. It requires careful planning and coordination to ensure that the required symbols are accessible to other modules and that unnecessary symbols are not exposed.

## 4. Lack of Fine-Grained Control

Although Swift's access control provides a reasonable level of control over code visibility, it may still lack some granularity. Swift only offers five access levels (`private`, `fileprivate`, `internal`, `public`, and `open`), which may not always cater to all use cases.

For instance, you cannot have different access levels for individual members within a type. All members within a `public` class will also be `public`, which can lead to potential security or encapsulation concerns.

## Conclusion

While access control in Swift provides valuable control over code visibility and accessibility, it is not without its drawbacks. Increased complexity, tedious boilerplate code, limitations in code reusability, and lack of fine-grained control are some of the notable limitations of access control.

It is crucial for developers to strike a balance between accessibility and complexity when using access control in their Swift projects. By carefully planning and structuring the codebase, developers can mitigate the drawbacks and leverage the benefits of access control effectively.
