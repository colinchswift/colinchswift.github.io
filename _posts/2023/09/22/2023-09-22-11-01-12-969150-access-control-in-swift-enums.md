In Swift, enums are a powerful feature that allows you to define a group of related values. Enums can often be used to model different states or options within your application. However, there may be cases where you want to restrict access to certain enum cases or provide different levels of access to different parts of your codebase. This is where access control in Swift enums comes in.

## Public Enums

By default, enums in Swift are internal, meaning that they can be accessed within the module they are defined in. However, you can also mark an enum as `public` to make it accessible from outside the module. This can be useful if you want to expose the enum as part of your API.

```swift
public enum MyEnum {
    case optionA
    case optionB
}
```

With this code, the `MyEnum` enum is now accessible from other modules and can be used in their code.

## Internal Enums

As mentioned earlier, enums are internal by default. This means that they can be accessed within the module they are defined in, but not from outside the module. This is the most common level of access control for enums within an application.

```swift
enum MyEnum {
    case optionA
    case optionB
}
```

The `MyEnum` enum in this example can be used within the current module, but not from other modules.

## Private Enums

In some cases, you may want to restrict access to an enum to only be within a specific scope or file. This can be achieved by marking the enum as `private`. When an enum is marked as `private`, it can only be accessed within the same file. This level of access control can be useful for encapsulating implementation details.

```swift
private enum MyEnum {
    case optionA
    case optionB
}
```

In this code, the `MyEnum` enum can only be accessed within the same file it is defined in, making it inaccessible from other files or modules.

## Conclusion

Access control in Swift enums allows you to control the visibility and accessibility of your enums within your codebase. By specifying the appropriate access control level for your enums, you can ensure that your code is organized and secure. Whether you need to expose an enum as part of your API or restrict access to certain parts of your code, access control in Swift enums gives you the flexibility to do so.
