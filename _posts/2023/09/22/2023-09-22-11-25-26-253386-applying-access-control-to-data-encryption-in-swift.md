Data encryption is a crucial aspect of many applications to ensure the security and privacy of sensitive information. In Swift, you can use various encryption algorithms to protect your data. However, it is equally important to apply access control measures to restrict unauthorized access to encrypted data.

Access control in Swift allows you to define who can access and modify your code or data. By using access modifiers, you can set the appropriate level of access for different parts of your application.

To apply access control to data encryption in Swift, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Define the Encryption Class

First, create a class to handle the encryption operations. Ensure that only authorized code can access and utilize this class. You can achieve this by setting the access level to `internal` or `private`.

```swift
internal class EncryptionManager {
    
    // Private encryption key
    private let encryptionKey = "mySecretKey"
    
    func encrypt(data: Data) -> Data? {
        // Encryption logic using the encryptionKey
        // ...
        return encryptedData
    }
    
    func decrypt(data: Data) -> Data? {
        // Decryption logic using the encryptionKey
        // ...
        return decryptedData
    }
}
```

## Step 2: Restrict Access to the Encryption Class

To restrict access to the `EncryptionManager` class, set the access level to `internal` or `private`. This way, only code within the same module or file can access this class.

```swift
internal class EncryptionManager {
    // ...
}
```

Alternatively, if you want to restrict access to only a specific portion of your codebase, you can make the class private.

```swift
private class EncryptionManager {
    // ...
}
```

## Step 3: Use the Encryption Class

Now, any code trying to access or use the `EncryptionManager` will need to be in the same module or file.

```swift
let encryptionManager = EncryptionManager()

let sensitiveData = "My secret information".data(using: .utf8)!

let encryptedData = encryptionManager.encrypt(data: sensitiveData)

let decryptedData = encryptionManager.decrypt(data: encryptedData)
```

By applying access control to the encryption class, you can ensure that only authorized parts of your codebase have access to the encryption/decryption operations. This helps to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Remember to choose the appropriate access level (`internal` or `private`) based on the desired level of access control.
