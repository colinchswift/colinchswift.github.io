Kingfisher is a popular framework for downloading and caching images in Swift. It provides a simple and efficient way to fetch images from the web and display them in your iOS app. However, when using a third-party library like Kingfisher, it is important to understand and apply access control to ensure proper encapsulation and maintainability of your code.

## Why apply access control?

Access control in Swift allows you to restrict the visibility and availability of your code symbols such as classes, properties, and methods. By applying access control, you can prevent unintended usage of certain parts of your code and enforce a clean and modular structure to your project. This helps in reducing code coupling, improving code maintenance, and enhancing security.

## Access control in Kingfisher

Kingfisher provides various classes, protocols, and extensions to facilitate image downloading and caching. When using Kingfisher in your project, it is recommended to follow these access control guidelines:

### 1. Keep your classes and methods private

To minimize external dependencies on Kingfisher and to prevent unnecessary access to its internals, make sure to mark your classes and methods that use Kingfisher as private. This will encapsulate your code and reduce the chances of it being accessed or tampered with by other parts of your app.

```swift
private class MyImageDownloader {
    private func downloadImage(url: URL) {
        // Using Kingfisher to download the image
        KingfisherManager.shared.retrieveImage(with: url, options: nil, progressBlock: nil) { result in
            switch result {
            case .success(let value):
                // Handle successful image download
                self.processImage(value.image)
            case .failure(let error):
                // Handle download failure
                print("Error downloading image: \(error)")
            }
        }
    }
    
    private func processImage(_ image: UIImage) {
        // Process the downloaded image
    }
}
```

### 2. Limit access to Kingfisher's internals

Although Kingfisher provides various properties and methods for customization, it is generally recommended to avoid direct access to its internals. Instead, rely on the provided APIs and extensions to interact with Kingfisher. This ensures that any future changes or updates to Kingfisher's internals won't break your code.

```swift
class MyImageView: UIImageView {
    func setImage(with url: URL) {
        // Using Kingfisher's extension to set the image
        kf.setImage(with: url)
    }
}
```

### 3. Utilize access control modifiers

Kingfisher itself utilizes access control modifiers to encapsulate its code and provide an appropriate level of visibility and availability. By following the same practice, you can ensure better maintainability and reduce the chances of code conflicts and unintended usage.

## Conclusion

Applying access control to third-party libraries like Kingfisher is crucial for maintaining encapsulation, modular structure, and code integrity in your project. By keeping your classes and methods private, limiting access to the library's internals, and utilizing access control modifiers, you can leverage the power of Kingfisher while ensuring the long-term maintainability of your codebase.
