The Codable protocol in Swift provides a convenient way to encode and decode data structures to and from various formats, such as JSON, without the need for manual serialization and deserialization. Although Codable works seamlessly for simple data structures, it can sometimes be challenging to handle more complex situations where branching or conditional encoding and decoding is required. In this article, we will explore different techniques to address such scenarios.

## Conditional Encoding

Conditional encoding is useful when you want to include or exclude certain properties in the encoded representation based on specific conditions. One approach is to define a custom `encode(to:)` method in your Codable struct or class, where you can manually encode properties conditionally.

```swift
struct MyClass: Codable {
    let value: String
    let optionalValue: String?

    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case value
        case optionalValue
    }

    func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
        var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        try container.encode(value, forKey: .value)

        if let optionalValue = optionalValue {
            try container.encode(optionalValue, forKey: .optionalValue)
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `optionalValue` property is only encoded if it contains a non-nil value. This allows for fine-grained control over the encoding process.

## Conditional Decoding

Conditional decoding is useful when you need to handle different data formats or structures during the decoding process. One way to achieve this is by implementing a custom `init(from:)` initializer that performs conditional logic based on the incoming data.

```swift
struct MyContainer: Decodable {
    let type: String
    let value: String

    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case type
        case value
    }

    init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)

        type = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .type)
        value = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .value)

        if type == "specialType" {
            // Decode additional properties specific to specialType
            let specialProperty = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .specialProperty)
            // Perform additional logic
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the decoding process is conditionally extended to handle a special case where the `type` property has a specific value. This allows for custom handling and additional decoding logic based on specific conditions.

## Conclusion

The Codable protocol in Swift provides a powerful and expressive way to handle encoding and decoding of data structures. By implementing custom `encode(to:)` and `init(from:)` methods, you can easily add branching and conditional logic to handle more complex scenarios during encoding and decoding. These techniques empower you to adapt the Codable behavior to suit your specific requirements.
