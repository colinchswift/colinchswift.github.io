Access control is an important feature in programming languages that allows developers to restrict the visibility and availability of classes, methods, properties, and other entities in their code. In Swift, there are five levels of access control: `open`, `public`, `internal`, `fileprivate`, and `private`. In this article, we will focus on how access control works specifically with classes in Swift.

## Class Declaration

When declaring a class in Swift, you can specify the access level by using one of the access control keywords before the `class` keyword. Here is an example:

```swift
public class MyClass {
    // class members go here
}
```

## Access Levels for Classes

Let's take a closer look at each access level and its implications for classes:

- `open`: The most permissive access level that allows the class to be subclassed and its members to be overridden by classes defined in other modules.
- `public`: Almost as permissive as `open`, but it doesn't allow subclassing or member overriding outside the module.
- `internal`: The default access level. The class and its members are accessible within the same module, but not outside of it.
- `fileprivate`: Limits the class and its members to be accessible only within the same source file.
- `private`: The most restrictive access level that restricts the class and its members to be accessible only within the enclosing declaration.

## Access Control for Class Members

In addition to specifying the access level for the class itself, you can also apply access control modifiers to individual class members such as properties and methods. Here's an example:

```swift
public class MyClass {
    fileprivate var privateProperty = 10
    private func privateMethod() {
        // do something
    }
    
    public func publicMethod() {
        // do something
    }
}
```

In the example above, the `privateProperty` and `privateMethod` are only accessible within the class itself, while the `publicMethod` is accessible from outside the module.

## Access Control and Subclassing

It's important to note that the access level of a subclass cannot be more restrictive than its superclass. For example, if a superclass is declared as `open`, the subclass cannot be `internal`, `fileprivate`, or `private`.

## Conclusion

Access control in Swift classes allows developers to define the visibility and availability of their code's entities. By understanding the different access levels and applying them appropriately, you can control how your classes and their members are accessed and manipulated. This helps in ensuring code integrity and encapsulation.
