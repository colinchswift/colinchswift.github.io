When working with Swift composition, it is important to consider access control to ensure the proper visibility and encapsulation of your code. Access control helps in defining the visibility of properties, methods, and other members within a class, struct, or enumeration.

Access control in Swift is split into five levels:

1. **Open**: The highest level of access, allowing entities to be accessed from anywhere, even from outside the module that declares it. This is primarily used when designing public-facing APIs.

2. **Public**: Similar to open, public access allows entities to be accessed from outside the module that declares it. However, it does not allow subclassing or overriding outside the module.

3. **Internal**: Internal access restricts entities to use within the module that declares them. They are not available outside the module. This is the default access level in Swift.

4. **File-private**: File-private access limits the scope of an entity to the source file that it is declared in. It cannot be accessed from any other source file within the same module.

5. **Private**: The most restrictive level, private access, limits the scope to the enclosing declaration. It cannot be accessed from anywhere outside the containing scope.

To apply access control to properties or methods within a composition, you can simply prepend the access modifier keyword. For example, to make a property private:

```swift
class MyClass {
    private var myProperty: Int

    init(myProperty: Int) {
        self.myProperty = myProperty
    }

    private func myPrivateMethod() {
        // Do something private here
    }
}
```

In the above example, `myProperty` and `myPrivateMethod` are marked as private, so they can only be accessed within the class `MyClass`. Other classes or entities outside `MyClass` cannot access or modify them.

When composing classes, the access level for a composed type should have at least the same access level as its most restricted member. For example, if a property in a composed type is marked as private, the composed type itself should not have a higher access level than private.

Understanding and properly setting access control in Swift composition is essential for creating modular and encapsulated code. By using the appropriate access levels, you can ensure that your code is organized and the visibility of your entities is controlled to prevent unwanted access or modifications.
