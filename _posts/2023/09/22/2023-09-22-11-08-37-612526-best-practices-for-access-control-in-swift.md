## Keep It Private
One of the fundamental principles of access control is to make entities as private as possible. By default, all entities in Swift have internal access, which means they can be accessed from anywhere within the same module. However, unless there is a good reason for wider access, it is recommended to mark entities as private or file-private.

* `private` access restricts an entity's usage to the enclosing declaration, such as a method or property within a class. 

* `fileprivate` access restricts an entity's usage to the current source file. This is useful when you want to limit access to a specific implementation or helper functions within a file.

## Use Internal and Public Access Wisely
While private and fileprivate access modifiers provide encapsulation and protect sensitive code from unintended modifications, there are cases where you need to expose certain elements for usage outside the module. Swift provides two additional access modifiers for this purpose - `internal` and `public`.

* `internal` access (default) allows entities to be accessed from anywhere within the same module. This is ideal for entities that need to be used internally within a framework or module.

* `public` access allows entities to be accessed from anywhere, including outside the module. This is useful when you want to expose APIs that should be accessible to other modules or frameworks.

When exposing APIs, it's important to carefully consider what elements should be public and choose a consistent naming convention that makes the purpose and usage clear. Also, keep in mind that changing a public API in the future may break existing client code, so it is recommended to follow semantic versioning principles.

## Access Levels for Frameworks and Libraries
If you are developing a framework or library that will be used by others, it's crucial to design a well-thought-out access control strategy. Here are a few best practices:

* Mark internal implementation details as fileprivate or private to prevent unintended usage or modifications by clients.

* Only expose a well-defined set of APIs as public. This helps to maintain a stable and consistent interface for users of your framework or library.

* Use access control modifiers such as `open` or `public` for classes, methods, or properties that are intended to be subclassed or overridden.

## Conclusion
Access control in Swift provides powerful tools to define the visibility and accessibility of code entities. By following best practices, such as keeping entities as private as possible, using internal and public access wisely, and carefully designing access levels for frameworks and libraries, you can create well-organized and maintainable codebases. Remember to choose the appropriate access modifiers for your entities and consider the long-term implications of exposing APIs. #Swift #AccessControl
