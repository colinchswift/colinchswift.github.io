When working on a Swift project that involves data decryption, it is important to ensure that only authorized parts of the code have access to the decrypted data. This can be achieved by utilizing access control in Swift.

Access control in Swift allows you to specify the level of access that types and their members have. By using access control modifiers, you can restrict the visibility and accessibility of properties, methods, and other types within your codebase.

## Encrypting and Decrypting Data

Before diving into access control, let's first understand the process of encrypting and decrypting data in Swift. Encryption is the process of converting plain text into a secret cipher, while decryption involves converting the cipher back into plain text.

```swift
// Example code for encrypting and decrypting data using AES encryption algorithm

import CryptoKit

func encryptData(data: Data, key: SymmetricKey) throws -> Data {
    let sealedBox = try AES.GCM.seal(data, using: key)
    return sealedBox.combined
}

func decryptData(encryptedData: Data, key: SymmetricKey) throws -> Data {
    let sealedBox = try AES.GCM.SealedBox(combined: encryptedData)
    let decryptedData = try AES.GCM.open(sealedBox, using: key)
    return decryptedData
}
```

In the above example, we are using the `CryptoKit` framework to perform AES encryption and decryption. The `encryptData` function takes a `Data` object and a symmetric key and returns the encrypted data. Similarly, the `decryptData` function takes encrypted data and the same symmetric key and returns the decrypted data.

## Applying Access Control

Now that we have an understanding of data encryption and decryption in Swift, let's see how we can apply access control to ensure that only authorized parts of our code have access to the decrypted data.

One way to achieve this is by creating a separate module or framework that handles the decryption process. This module can have a class or struct with limited access, exposing only the necessary methods for decryption.

```swift
// Example code demonstrating access control in a decryption framework

module DecryptionModule {
    private enum DecryptionError: Error {
        case decryptionFailed
    }

    public static func decryptData(encryptedData: Data, key: SymmetricKey) throws -> Data {
        let sealedBox = try AES.GCM.SealedBox(combined: encryptedData)
        guard let decryptedData = try? AES.GCM.open(sealedBox, using: key) else {
            throw DecryptionError.decryptionFailed
        }
        return decryptedData
    }
}
```

In the above example, we create a module called `DecryptionModule`. The `decryptData` function within the module is marked as `public`, allowing other parts of the code to access it. However, the `DecryptionError` enum is marked as `private`, making it accessible only within the module.

By encapsulating the decryption logic within a separate module with limited access, we ensure that other parts of the codebase cannot directly access the decrypted data. This helps in maintaining data security and minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.

## Conclusion

Access control in Swift provides a powerful mechanism to control the visibility and accessibility of code within your project. By applying access control to data decryption, you can ensure that only authorized parts of your code have access to sensitive decrypted data. By encapsulating the decryption logic within a separate module with restricted access, you can enhance data security and reduce potential vulnerabilities.
