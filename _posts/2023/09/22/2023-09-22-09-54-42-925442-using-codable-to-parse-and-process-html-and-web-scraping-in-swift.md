Web scraping is a common practice in extracting information from websites. Swift, with its powerful Codable feature, allows us to easily parse and process HTML content retrieved from websites. This blog post will guide you through the process of using Codable to parse and process HTML in Swift.

### Step 1: Retrieving HTML content

Before we can begin parsing HTML, we need to retrieve the HTML content from a website. We can use URLSession to make a request to the website and get the HTML content as a response. Here's an example of how we can do this:

```swift
let url = URL(string: "https://example.com")!
let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in
    if let error = error {
        print("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        return
    }
    guard let data = data else {
        print("No data received")
        return
    }
    
    let htmlString = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)
    // Process the HTML content using Codable
}
task.resume()
```
In the above code, we create a URL object with the desired website URL. We then use URLSession.shared.dataTask(with:completionHandler:) to make an asynchronous network request. Once we receive the data, we can convert it to a String using the `String(data:encoding:)` initializer and proceed with parsing.

### Step 2: Creating Codable Models

In order to parse HTML content using Codable, we need to define Codable models that mirror the structure of the HTML. This involves identifying the relevant HTML elements and their attributes that we want to extract.

Let's imagine we want to extract information about products from an e-commerce website. We identify that each product is represented by a `div` element with a class name of `product`. We can create a Codable model like this:

```swift
struct Product: Codable {
    let name: String
    let price: String
}
```
We can then create a wrapper model representing the entire HTML content:

```swift
struct ProductsResponse: Codable {
    let products: [Product]
}
```

### Step 3: Parsing HTML using Codable

Now that we have our Codable models, we can use the `JSONDecoder` class to parse the HTML content into our model objects. Here's how we can do it:

```swift
do {
    let decoder = JSONDecoder()
    let data = Data(htmlString.utf8)
    let productsResponse = try decoder.decode(ProductsResponse.self, from: data)
    
    // Access the parsed data
    let products = productsResponse.products
    for product in products {
        print("Product: \(product.name), Price: \(product.price)")
    }
} catch {
    print("Error decoding HTML: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

In the above code, we create a `JSONDecoder` object and decode the HTML content into our `ProductsResponse` model object. We can now access the parsed data and process it according to our requirements.

### Conclusion

Using Swift's Codable feature, we can easily parse and process HTML content retrieved from websites. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can efficiently extract the desired information from HTML in a structured and type-safe manner. Happy coding!
