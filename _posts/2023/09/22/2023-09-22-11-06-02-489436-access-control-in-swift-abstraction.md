When working on larger projects or collaborating with other developers, it's important to have control over the accessibility of your code. Swift provides powerful access control features that allow you to determine which parts of your code can be accessed by other code or modules.

In Swift, access control is applied at the **module** level, which refers to a single unit of code that can be distributed and imported separately. This could be a framework, library, or app bundle. Let's take a closer look at the different access control levels available in Swift and how they can be applied to abstract your code.

## Public Access

The most open level of access control is `public`. When a component is marked as public, it can be accessed from any source file within the same module, as well as from other modules that have imported the module. This is commonly used for defining public APIs that need to be accessible externally.

```swift
public class MyPublicClass {
    public var myPublicVariable: Int
    public init() {
        myPublicVariable = 0
    }
    public func myPublicMethod() {
        // Code implementation
    }
}
```

## Internal Access

The `internal` access level is the default access level in Swift, meaning that if no access level modifier is specified, the code element is considered internal. Internal access allows the component to be accessed from any source file within the same module, but not from outside the module. This is useful for organizing and encapsulating code within a module.

```swift
internal class MyInternalClass {
    internal var myInternalVariable: String
    internal init() {
        myInternalVariable = ""
    }
    internal func myInternalMethod() {
        // Code implementation
    }
}
```

## Private Access

The most restrictive access level is `private`, which limits the access to the containing declaration. This means that a private component can only be accessed from within the same source file. Private access is useful for encapsulating implementation details and preventing access from other parts of the codebase.

```swift
fileprivate class MyPrivateClass {
    fileprivate var myPrivateVariable: Double
    fileprivate init() {
        myPrivateVariable = 0.0
    }
    fileprivate func myPrivateMethod() {
        // Code implementation
    }
}
```

## Access Control in Abstraction

Access control in Swift can also be applied to **abstraction** layers, such as protocols and protocol methods. By default, protocol methods are treated as `internal`, but you can specify a different access level to restrict or widen their accessibility.

```swift
public protocol MyPublicProtocol {
    func myPublicProtocolMethod()
}

internal protocol MyInternalProtocol {
    func myInternalProtocolMethod()
}

private protocol MyPrivateProtocol {
    func myPrivateProtocolMethod()
}
```

By choosing the appropriate access control level for your code components, you can ensure that your code is properly encapsulated, maintainable, and secure. Remember to use access control strategically to expose only the necessary parts of your code to other modules or developers.
