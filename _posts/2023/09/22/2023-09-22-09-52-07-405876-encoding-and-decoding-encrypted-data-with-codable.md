With the rise in privacy concerns, it has become crucial to ensure that data is encrypted and protected. Codable, introduced in Swift 4, provides an elegant way to encode and decode data. However, when dealing with sensitive information, it is also important to encrypt the data to safeguard it from unauthorized access.

In this blog post, we will explore how to encode and decode encrypted data using Codable in Swift.

## Encrypting Data

Before we dive into implementing Codable, let's take a look at encrypting data using Swift's `CryptoKit` framework. `CryptoKit` is a powerful and easy-to-use framework that provides cryptographic operations in Swift.

To encrypt data, we need to follow a few steps:

1. Generate a random encryption key using `SymmetricKey`.
2. Create an instance of `AES.GCM`, which stands for Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois/Counter Mode.
3. Create an instance of `AES.GCM.SealedBox` by encrypting the data using our encryption key and the `AES.GCM`.

```swift
import CryptoKit

func encryptData(data: Data, encryptionKey: SymmetricKey) throws -> Data {
    let sealedBox = try AES.GCM.seal(data, using: encryptionKey)
    return sealedBox.combined
}
```

## Decrypting Data

After encrypting the data, we can now move on to implementing the decryption logic. Decryption follows a similar process:

1. Create an instance of `AES.GCM.SealedBox` by extracting the nonce and ciphertext from the encrypted data.
2. Decrypt the data using the encryption key and the `AES.GCM` algorithm.

```swift
func decryptData(encryptedData: Data, encryptionKey: SymmetricKey) throws -> Data {
    let sealedBox = try AES.GCM.SealedBox(combined: encryptedData)
    return try AES.GCM.open(sealedBox, using: encryptionKey)
}
```

## Encoding and Decoding Encrypted Data with Codable

Now that we have encryption and decryption methods in place, we can combine them with Codable to encode and decode encrypted data.

Let's consider an example where we have a `User` struct that contains sensitive information, such as username and email:

```swift
struct User: Codable {
    let username: String
    let email: String
}
```

To encode the data, we can first convert the `User` instance to `Data`, and then encrypt the data using our encryption key.

```swift
let user = User(username: "john_doe", email: "john@example.com")
let encoder = JSONEncoder()
let data = try encoder.encode(user)
let encryptedData = try encryptData(data: data, encryptionKey: encryptionKey)
```

To decode the encrypted data, we follow a similar process: decrypt the data and then decode it back into the `User` instance.

```swift
let decryptedData = try decryptData(encryptedData: encryptedData, encryptionKey: encryptionKey)
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
let decryptedUser = try decoder.decode(User.self, from: decryptedData)
```

By combining Codable with encryption techniques, we can now securely encode and decode our sensitive data without compromising its privacy.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to encode and decode encrypted data using Codable in Swift. We saw how to encrypt and decrypt data using `CryptoKit` and then combined it with Codable to seamlessly handle the encryption and decryption process.

Encrypting sensitive data is crucial in today's privacy-focused world, and Codable provides a convenient way to work with encrypted data. Incorporating security measures like encryption into your app ensures that user data remains protected against unauthorized access.
