In any application that interacts with an API, it's important to ensure that only authorized users can access certain endpoints. Access control is a crucial aspect of security, and Swift provides powerful tools to implement it effectively.

In Swift, we can use access control modifiers to restrict access to properties, methods, and classes. By using these modifiers, we can define the level of access the components of our code have.

Here are some commonly used access control modifiers in Swift:

## `public`
The `public` modifier allows entities to be accessed from any source file or module, including external modules. This is the highest level of access and should be used for interfaces that need to be accessed by other parts of the application or external dependencies.

## `internal`
The `internal` modifier is the default access level in Swift. It allows entities to be accessed within the same module but not from outside. This is useful for internal API endpoints that should not be accessed by external sources.

## `private`
The `private` modifier restricts access to entities within the same source file. This is helpful for securing sensitive API endpoints that should only be accessed within a specific context.

To secure API endpoints in Swift, we can use access control modifiers at the class level, the method level, or the individual endpoint level. Here's an example of how we can apply access control to a simple API endpoint class:

```swift
public class APIService {

    private let apiKey: String
    
    public init(apiKey: String) {
        self.apiKey = apiKey
    }
    
    public func fetchUserData() {
        // Implementation goes here
    }
    
    private func authenticate() {
        // Implementation goes here
    }
}
```

In this example, the `APIService` class is marked as `public`, which means it can be accessed from any source file or module. However, the `apiKey` property is marked as `private`, restricting access to within the same source file. This ensures that the API key remains secure and is not accessible outside of the class.

The `fetchUserData()` method is marked as `public`, indicating that it can be accessed externally. However, the `authenticate()` method is marked as `private`, making it accessible only within the class itself. This adds an extra layer of security by preventing unauthorized access to the authentication logic.

By using access control modifiers effectively, we can secure API endpoints and ensure that only authorized users can interact with them. It is important to carefully design and implement access control in a way that meets the security requirements of the application.
