In Swift, access control is a feature that allows you to restrict the visibility and accessibility of your code's properties, methods, and other entities. When it comes to overriding, access control plays a crucial role in determining what can be overridden and accessed in a subclass.

## Access Levels in Swift

Before diving into overriding, let's quickly go through the different access levels available in Swift:

1. **Open**: The highest access level, which allows entities to be accessed and overridden from any source file or module.
2. **Public**: Similar to open access, but slightly less permissive. Public entities can be accessed from any source file but cannot be overridden outside of the module they are defined in.
3. **Internal**: The default access level in Swift. Internal entities can be accessed from any source file within the same module but are not accessible when imported into a different module.
4. **File-private**: Limits the accessibility of an entity to the source file it is defined in.
5. **Private**: The most restricted access level, limiting the visibility of an entity to the enclosing declaration.

## Overriding Access Control

In Swift, the access level of an overridden entity cannot be more restrictive than its superclass's access level. This means that you cannot override a `private` or `file-private` entity with a higher access level like `internal`, `public`, or `open`.

On the other hand, you can override an entity with a higher access level. For example, if a superclass has a method defined as `internal`, you can override it in a subclass with `public`. This is because the subclass is allowed to expose a more accessible API than its superclass.

To override a method, property, or initializer, specify the `override` keyword before the declaration:

```swift
class Vehicle {
    internal var brand: String = "Unknown"

    internal func startEngine() {
        print("Engine started")
    }
}

public class Car: Vehicle {
    public override var brand: String {
        didSet {
            print("Brand updated: \(brand)")
        }
    }

    public override func startEngine() {
        super.startEngine()
        print("Car engine started")
    }
}
```

In the example above, the `brand` property and `startEngine` method are both overridden in the `Car` subclass. The `brand` property is made `public` in the subclass, allowing it to be accessed from any source file or module. Similarly, the `startEngine` method is made `public` to expose the specific behavior relevant to a car.

## Conclusion

Access control in Swift enables you to control the visibility and accessibility of your code. When it comes to overriding, it's important to understand how access levels interact and how they affect the functionality of subclasses. By utilizing appropriate access levels, you can ensure that your code is both secure and flexible.
