## Introduction
Access control is an essential aspect of any programming language, including Swift. It allows you to define the visibility and availability of various entities like classes, structs, functions, and more within your codebase. In this blog post, we will explore how to apply access control to SwiftyJSON, a popular JSON parsing library in Swift.

## Understanding Access Control in Swift
Before diving into applying access control to SwiftyJSON, let's have a brief overview of the different access control levels available in Swift:

1. **Open:** The highest access level, accessible from any source file in any module. Typically used when defining public interfaces that need to be subclassed or overridden.
2. **Public:** Accessible from any source file within the module and other modules that import the module. Recommended for framework or library APIs.
3. **Internal:** Accessible from any source file within the module but not available outside the module. This is the default access level for most entities.
4. **Fileprivate:** Accessible only from within the same source file where it is defined. Useful to restrict access within a specific file.
5. **Private:** The most restrictive access level, accessible only from within the enclosing declaration's scope. Useful to limit access to a specific block of code.

## Applying Access Control to SwiftyJSON
SwiftyJSON is a lightweight JSON parsing library that provides an easy way to access and manipulate JSON data in Swift. By default, SwiftyJSON uses the `public` access level for its classes and functions. However, you may want to restrict the access level according to your project requirements.

To apply access control to SwiftyJSON, you can create an extension in your project and modify the access levels of SwiftyJSON's entities. Here's an example:

```swift
import SwiftyJSON

extension JSON {
    // Custom private method to access SwiftyJSON's internal '_value' property
    private var customValue: Any? {
        return self._value
    }
    
    // Custom public method to access SwiftyJSON's 'dictionary' property
    public var customDictionary: [String: JSON]? {
        return self.dictionary
    }
    
    // Custom internal method to access SwiftyJSON's 'array' property
    internal var customArray: [JSON]? {
        return self.array
    }
}
```

In the above example, we have created an extension for the `JSON` class provided by SwiftyJSON. We have modified the access levels of two properties: `customValue` and `customArray`. The `customValue` property is marked as `private`, making it accessible only within the extension. The `customDictionary` property is marked as `public`, allowing access from anywhere outside the module. Finally, the `customArray` property is marked as `internal`, restricting access to the same module.

By leveraging such extensions, you can fine-tune the access levels of SwiftyJSON's entities according to your project's requirements.

## Conclusion
Applying access control to SwiftyJSON in Swift allows you to have more control over the visibility and accessibility of JSON parsing functionality within your codebase. By defining different access levels for SwiftyJSON's entities, you can ensure that only the necessary parts of the library are exposed to other modules or restrict access within specific files. This flexibility empowers you to write more secure and modular Swift applications. #Swift #SwiftyJSON
