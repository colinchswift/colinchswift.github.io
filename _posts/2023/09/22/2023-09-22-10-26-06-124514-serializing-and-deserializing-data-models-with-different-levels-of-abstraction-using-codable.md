In modern software development, data serialization and deserialization are fundamental processes for storing and transferring data. [Swift's Codable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable) protocol provides an easy and efficient way to encode and decode data models. One of the powerful aspects of Codable is the ability to handle data models with different levels of abstraction. In this article, we will explore how to serialize and deserialize data models with varying levels of abstraction using Codable.

## Understanding Different Levels of Abstraction

Data models often have different levels of abstraction. For example, you may have a high-level data model that represents a complex entity with multiple properties and relationships. On the other hand, you may also have a simplified data model that represents a subset of properties from the high-level model. The high-level model may include additional properties and relationships that are not present in the simplified model.

## Encoding and Decoding Strategies

When working with data models of different levels of abstraction, we can employ different encoding and decoding strategies using Codable. Let's explore some common scenarios:

### Encoding a High-Level Model to a Simplified Model

Suppose we have a high-level data model called `HighLevelModel`:

```swift
struct HighLevelModel: Codable {
    let propertyA: String
    let propertyB: Int
    // ...
    let propertyZ: Bool
}
```

And we also have a simplified data model called `SimplifiedModel`:

```swift
struct SimplifiedModel: Codable {
    let propertyA: String
    let propertyB: Int
}
```

To encode a `HighLevelModel` to a `SimplifiedModel`, we can create an instance of `SimplifiedModel` using the relevant properties from `HighLevelModel`:

```swift
let highLevelModel = HighLevelModel(propertyA: "Value A", propertyB: 5, propertyZ: true)

let simplifiedModel = SimplifiedModel(propertyA: highLevelModel.propertyA, propertyB: highLevelModel.propertyB)
```

### Decoding a Simplified Model to a High-Level Model

The reverse process involves decoding a `SimplifiedModel` and creating a `HighLevelModel` by populating only the relevant properties:

```swift
let simplifiedData = """
{
    "propertyA": "Value A",
    "propertyB": 5
}
""".data(using: .utf8)!

let decoder = JSONDecoder()

if let simplifiedModel = try? decoder.decode(SimplifiedModel.self, from: simplifiedData) {
    let highLevelModel = HighLevelModel(propertyA: simplifiedModel.propertyA, propertyB: simplifiedModel.propertyB)
    
    // Use the high level model
}
```

### Ignoring Extra Properties during Decoding

Another scenario is when we have a JSON payload with additional properties that are not present in the simplified data model. In such cases, we can use the `JSONDecoder`'s `keyDecodingStrategy` option to ignore unknown keys.

```swift
let json = """
{
    "propertyA": "Value A",
    "propertyB": 5,
    "propertyC": "Value C",
    "propertyD": true
}
""".data(using: .utf8)!

let decoder = JSONDecoder()
decoder.keyDecodingStrategy = .convertFromSnakeCase
decoder.userInfo[CodingUserInfoKey.ignoreUnknownKeys] = true

let simplifiedModel = try? decoder.decode(SimplifiedModel.self, from: json)
```

## Conclusion

Swift's Codable protocol provides a versatile solution for serializing and deserializing data models with different levels of abstraction. By employing different encoding and decoding strategies, we can handle complex data models, extract relevant information, and ignore extra properties during the process. This flexibility allows developers to work with data in a more efficient and concise manner.

With the power of Codable, you can easily handle data models at varying levels of abstraction, making your code more flexible and adaptable. #SwiftCoding #DataModeling
