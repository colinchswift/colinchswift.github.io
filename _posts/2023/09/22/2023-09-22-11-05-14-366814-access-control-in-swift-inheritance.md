Swift provides powerful access control mechanisms to restrict the visibility and usage of code entities like classes, methods, properties, and more. Inheritance is an important aspect of object-oriented programming, and it is essential to understand how access control works in the context of inheritance in Swift.

## Access Levels in Swift

Swift offers five different access levels to control the visibility and accessibility of code entities:

1. **Open**: The highest access level, allows a code entity to be subclassed or overridden in the module that defines it, as well as in any module that imports the module where it is defined.
2. **Public**: Allows a code entity to be accessed from any source file or module, but cannot be subclassed or overridden outside the module it is defined in.
3. **Internal**: The default access level, allows a code entity to be accessed within the module it is defined in, but not from outside that module.
4. **File-private**: Limits the visibility of a code entity to the source file where it is defined. It cannot be accessed from any other source file in the same module.
5. **Private**: The most restrictive access level, limits the visibility of a code entity only to the enclosing declaration or scope.

## Inheritance and Access Levels

In Swift, when a subclass inherits from a superclass, there are certain rules regarding access levels that need to be followed. These rules ensure that the access level of the superclass's members is not compromised in the subclass.

1. The access level of a subclass cannot be higher than the access level of its superclass. For example, if a superclass has an access level of `internal`, the subclass cannot have an access level of `public`.
2. Overriding a superclass's member in a subclass is subject to the same access control rules. Therefore, a subclass cannot override a member with a lower access level.

To illustrate these concepts, consider the following example:

```swift
open class SuperClass {
    open func show() {
        print("This is a superclass.")
    }
}

public class SubClass: SuperClass {
    override public func show() {
        print("This is a subclass.")
    }
}
```

In this example, the `SuperClass` is defined as `open` and its `show()` method is marked as `open`. The `SubClass` inherits from `SuperClass` and overrides the `show()` method with a higher access level of `public`. This is allowed because the subclass's access level cannot be lower than that of the superclass.

## Conclusion

Understanding access control in the context of inheritance is crucial for designing secure and maintainable Swift code. By applying the appropriate access levels to your code entities, you can control their visibility and ensure that the integrity of your classes and their members is preserved. Remember to consider the access levels of both the superclass and the subclass when designing your inheritance hierarchy.
