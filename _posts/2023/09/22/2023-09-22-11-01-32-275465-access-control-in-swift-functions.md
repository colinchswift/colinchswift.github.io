In Swift, access control allows you to define the visibility and availability of your code entities, including functions. This helps in creating modular and secure code by controlling the accessibility of specific functionalities. In this blog post, we will explore how to apply access control to functions in Swift.

## Basic Access Control Levels

Swift provides five access control levels to choose from:

1. **Open:** The highest access level, allowing entities to be accessed from any source file or module.
2. **Public:** Entities with this access level can be accessed from any source file in the module and from other modules that import the defining module.
3. **Internal:** The default access level, making entities available within the module, but not outside of it.
4. **File Private:** Limits access to the source file where the entity is defined.
5. **Private:** The most restrictive access level, limiting the entity's visibility to its enclosing declaration.

## Applying Access Control to Functions

To apply access control to a function in Swift, you can use the `public`, `internal`, `fileprivate`, or `private` keywords before the `func` keyword. Let's take a look at each of these access levels in detail:

### Public Functions

```swift
public func showFriends() {
    // Code to display friends
}
```

A public function can be accessed from both within the module and from other modules that import the defining module. This access level is useful when you want to expose a function's functionality to other parts of your application or to external libraries.

### Internal Functions

```swift
internal func calculateAverage() {
    // Code to calculate average
}
```

An internal function is accessible within the module it is defined in, making it the default access level for functions. This level of access control is useful for functions that should only be accessible within the defining module.

### File Private Functions

```swift
fileprivate func handleTouch() {
    // Code to handle touch input
}
```

A file private function can only be accessed from the same source file where it is defined. This level of access control is useful for functions that should only be used within a specific file.

### Private Functions

```swift
private func encryptData() {
    // Code to encrypt data
}
```

A private function is accessible only within the enclosing declaration. This access level is useful when you want to restrict the visibility of a function to the specific context it belongs to.

## Conclusion

By applying access control to functions in Swift, you can ensure that your code is modular, secure, and follows the principle of least privilege. Choose the appropriate access control level depending on your specific requirements, and leverage the power of Swift's access control features to create robust and efficient applications.
