In object-oriented programming, access control is a crucial feature that helps in ensuring the security and integrity of data and resources. This is especially important when it comes to file manipulation in Swift, where you want to have fine-grained control over who can read, write, or delete files.

## Understanding Access Control in Swift

Access control in Swift is achieved through the use of access control modifiers. There are three levels of access control:

1. **Public**: Entities declared as public are accessible from anywhere in the same module, as well as from other modules that import the module where the entity is declared.
2. **Internal**: Entities declared as internal are accessible within the same module where they are defined, but not outside of it. This is the default access level in Swift.
3. **Private**: Entities declared as private are only accessible within the scope of the same declaration or file.

## Applying Access Control to File Manipulation

Let's consider a scenario where you have a Swift application that deals with sensitive user data stored in files. To ensure the security of this data, you can apply access control to the file manipulation operations.

### 1. Set File Permissions

You can set the file permissions to control who can read, write, or delete the file. In Swift, you can use the `FileManager` class to set file permissions using access control masks. For example:

```swift
import Foundation

let fileURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "path/to/file.txt")

do {
    let fileAttributes = try FileManager.default.attributesOfItem(atPath: fileURL.path)
    var permissions = fileAttributes[.posixPermissions] as! UInt16
    
    // Modify permissions as per your requirements
    permissions |= 0o200 // Add write access to owner
    permissions &= ~0o022 // Remove write and execute access from group and others
    
    try FileManager.default.setAttributes([.posixPermissions: permissions], ofItemAtPath: fileURL.path)
} catch {
    print("Failed to set file permissions: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```
### 2. Limit File Access with Custom Wrapper

Another approach is to create a custom file wrapper class that encapsulates the file manipulation operations and enforces access control. Here's an example of how you can implement a file wrapper class using access control:

```swift
import Foundation

public enum FileAccessLevel {
    case read
    case write
    case delete
}

public class FileWrapper {
    private let filePath: String
    
    public init(filePath: String) {
        self.filePath = filePath
    }
    
    public func manipulateFile(accessLevel: FileAccessLevel) throws {
        switch accessLevel {
        case .read:
            // Read file operations
            break
        case .write:
            // Write file operations
            break
        case .delete:
            // Delete file operations
            break
        }
    }
}
```
With the custom `FileWrapper` class, you can control file access by allowing or disallowing specific operations based on the access level.

## Conclusion

Access control in Swift provides a powerful mechanism to enforce security and restrict file manipulation operations. By using access control modifiers and custom wrapper classes, you can ensure that sensitive data stored in files remains secure and only accessible to authorized users.
