Exception handling is an essential part of any robust software development process. It allows developers to gracefully handle unexpected errors and prevent their propagation throughout the program. In Swift, exception handling is done using the `try`, `catch`, and `throw` keywords.

However, in some cases, you may want to restrict access to your exception handling code to ensure that it is only used in specific situations or by certain modules. Swift provides access control modifiers that allow you to define the visibility and availability of your code. In this blog post, we will explore how to apply access control to exception handling in Swift.

## 1. Private Exception Handling

By default, exception handling code in Swift is accessible from anywhere within the same module. However, you may want to restrict access to certain exception handling code to prevent misuse or unauthorized access.

To make an exception handling code private, you can use the `private` access control modifier. This makes the code accessible only within the same file where it is defined:

```swift
private func handleException() throws {
    // Exception handling code goes here
}
```

By declaring the `handleException` function as private, you ensure that it can only be called within the same file. Other files within the module or external modules won't be able to access or call this method.

## 2. Internal Exception Handling

If you want to make your exception handling code accessible within the same module but not outside of it, you can use the `internal` access control modifier. This is the default access level in Swift for most declarations, including functions and variables.

```swift
internal func handleException() throws {
    // Exception handling code goes here
}
```

By declaring the `handleException` function as internal, it is accessible within the same module but cannot be accessed from files outside of it.

## 3. Public Exception Handling

In some cases, you may want to allow other modules or packages to access your exception handling code. To do this, you can use the `public` or `open` access control modifiers.

```swift
public func handleException() throws {
    // Exception handling code goes here
}
```

By declaring the `handleException` function as public, you make it accessible from any file within the module or from external modules that import your module. This allows other developers to catch and handle exceptions thrown by your code.

## Conclusion

Applying access control to exception handling in Swift provides an additional layer of security and control over your codebase. By restricting access to exception handling code, you can prevent unauthorized usage and ensure that it is only used in appropriate scenarios.

Remember to consider the access level carefully when designing your exception handling code. Choose the appropriate access control modifier based on your specific requirements to strike the right balance between accessibility and code organization.
