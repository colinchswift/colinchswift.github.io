With the introduction of Codable in Swift, handling JSON parsing and encoding has become much more streamlined. However, there may be cases where the default error handling provided by Codable is not sufficient for your needs. In such cases, it is important to implement custom error handling and recovery strategies to gracefully handle decoding failures.

## Understanding Codable Error Handling

When decoding a JSON payload using Codable, Swift will throw a `DecodingError` if the data cannot be decoded correctly. By default, Swift provides a few options to handle these errors:

1. **Crashing:** By default, if an error occurs during decoding, the application will crash and the error will be logged in the console.
2. **Optionals:** You can mark properties as optionals in your Codable data model. If a property cannot be decoded, it will be set to `nil`.
3. **Ignoring Errors:** You can use the `try?` keyword to attempt decoding, which will return `nil` if an error occurs.

While these default options may work in simple scenarios, they may not be sufficient for handling more complex cases or providing meaningful feedback to the user. Let's explore how we can implement custom error handling and recovery strategies.

## Custom Error Handling

To implement custom error handling, we need to conform our Codable data model to the `Decodable` protocol and override the `init(from:)` initializer. Within this initializer, we can catch and handle specific decoding errors as we see fit.

```swift
struct User: Decodable {
    let id: Int
    let name: String

    init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)

        do {
            id = try container.decode(Int.self, forKey: .id)
            name = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .name)
        } catch let error as DecodingError {
            // Handle specific decoding errors
            switch error {
                case .typeMismatch(let type, let context):
                    // Handle type mismatch errors
                    // ...
                case .valueNotFound(let type, let context):
                    // Handle missing value errors
                    // ...
                case .keyNotFound(let key, let context):
                    // Handle missing key errors
                    // ...
                case .dataCorrupted(let context):
                    // Handle corrupted data errors
                    // ...
            }
        } catch {
            // Handle other errors
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we catch the decoding errors using a `do-catch` block and handle each error case individually. You can customize the error handling logic based on your application's requirements. For example, you can log the error, provide a default value, or display an error message to the user.

## Custom Recovery Strategies

In addition to error handling, you may also want to implement custom recovery strategies to recover from decoding failures. These recovery strategies can be implemented by providing default values or transforming the failed decoding into a valid state.

Consider the following example where we have a `User` data model with an optional `age` property. If the `age` cannot be decoded, we can automatically set it to a default value.

```swift
struct User: Decodable {
    let id: Int
    let name: String
    let age: Int?

    init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)

        do {
            id = try container.decode(Int.self, forKey: .id)
            name = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .name)
            age = try container.decodeIfPresent(Int.self, forKey: .age)
        } catch {
            // Handle decoding errors
            // ...
            
            // Set a default value for 'age'
            age = 0
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, if decoding the `age` fails, we catch the error and set `age` to a default value of 0. This ensures that the `User` object is always in a valid state, even if the `age` information is missing or incorrect.

## Conclusion

By implementing custom error handling and recovery strategies for Codable decoding failures, you can ensure your application gracefully handles unexpected scenarios and provides a better user experience. Custom error handling allows you to handle specific decoding errors and provide meaningful feedback, while custom recovery strategies enable you to transform failed decodings into valid states.
