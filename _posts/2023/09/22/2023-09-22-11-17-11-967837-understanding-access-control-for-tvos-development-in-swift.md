As a tvOS developer, understanding access control is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of your codebase. Access control allows you to define the level of access or visibility that other parts of your code or external modules have to specific entities such as classes, structs, properties, and methods.

In Swift, there are five levels of access control that you can use:

## 1. `private` 

The `private` access control restricts the scope of an entity to the enclosing declaration, such as a class, struct, or extension. This means that the entity can only be accessed within the same file it is declared in. This level of access control is ideal for hiding implementation details and preventing access from other parts of your codebase.

For example:

```swift
private struct PrivateStruct {
    private var privateProperty: Int = 0

    private func privateMethod() {
        // Implementation code
    }
}

private class PrivateClass {
    private var privateProperty: Int = 0

    private func privateMethod() {
        // Implementation code
    }
}
```

## 2. `fileprivate` 

The `fileprivate` access control restricts the scope of an entity to the source file it is declared in. This means that you can access the entity from anywhere within the same file, but not from other files. It is useful when you want to share code within a file, but not expose it to other parts of your project.

For example:

```swift
fileprivate struct FilePrivateStruct {
    fileprivate var fileprivateProperty: Int = 0

    fileprivate func fileprivateMethod() {
        // Implementation code
    }
}

fileprivate class FilePrivateClass {
    fileprivate var fileprivateProperty: Int = 0

    fileprivate func fileprivateMethod() {
        // Implementation code
    }
}
```

## 3. `internal` 

The `internal` access control is the default level of access control in Swift. It allows entities to be accessed from anywhere within the module where they are defined. A module is a single unit of code distribution which can be a framework, app, or a collection of files in the same project. Entities with internal access control are not accessible outside of the module.

For example:

```swift
internal struct InternalStruct {
    internal var internalProperty: Int = 0

    internal func internalMethod() {
        // Implementation code
    }
}

internal class InternalClass {
    internal var internalProperty: Int = 0

    internal func internalMethod() {
        // Implementation code
    }
}
```

## 4. `public` 

The `public` access control allows entities to be accessed from any source file within the module where they are defined and also from other modules that import the module where they are defined. This level of access control is useful when you want to expose interfaces that can be used by other parts of your project or by external modules.

For example:

```swift
public struct PublicStruct {
    public var publicProperty: Int = 0

    public func publicMethod() {
        // Implementation code
    }
}

public class PublicClass {
    public var publicProperty: Int = 0

    public func publicMethod() {
        // Implementation code
    }
}
```

## 5. `open` 

The `open` access control is similar to `public`, but with a higher level of access. In addition to being accessible from any source file within the module and from external modules, entities with `open` access control can also be subclassed and overridden by other modules. This level of access control is typically used for frameworks or libraries that are intended to be extended and customized.

For example:

```swift
open class OpenClass {
    open var openProperty: Int = 0

    open func openMethod() {
        // Implementation code
    }
}
```

Understanding access control in Swift is fundamental for writing clean and maintainable code. By properly setting the access levels for your entities, you can control data encapsulation, prevent unwanted access, and create clear boundaries within your codebase. Utilize the appropriate access control levels based on your project's requirements and security considerations.
