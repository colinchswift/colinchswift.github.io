In object-oriented programming, access levels are used to control the visibility and accessibility of classes, properties, methods, and other elements within a program. Swift, being a statically-typed language, provides different access levels to help developers manage the encapsulation and modularity of their code.

## Access Levels in Swift

Swift provides five different access levels, listed in descending order according to their level of restriction:

1. `open`: The highest level of access, allows entities to be accessed and subclassed from external modules.
2. `public`: Allows entities to be accessed from external modules, but cannot be subclassed or overridden.
3. `internal`: The default access level if no access level modifier is specified. Allows entities to be accessed within the same module.
4. `fileprivate`: Restricts the access to the defining source file.
5. `private`: The most restrictive access level, limits the access to the enclosing declaration.

## Open Access Level

The `open` access level is the highest level available in Swift. It provides the most flexibility, as entities marked as `open` can be subclassed and overridden from external modules. This makes it suitable for creating reusable libraries or frameworks that others can extend and customize for their specific needs.

To mark a class, method, property, or other entity as `open`, simply use the `open` keyword before its declaration:

```swift
open class MyOpenClass {
    open var myOpenProperty: String

    public init() {
        self.myOpenProperty = "Default Value"
    }

    open func myOpenMethod() {
        // Code implementation
    }
}
```

In the example above, the `MyOpenClass` is declared as `open`, allowing it to be subclassed and overridden by other developers.

## Using Open Access Level

When using an `open` entity from another module, you can subclass it, override its methods, and access its properties. Here's an example of subclassing the `MyOpenClass` and overriding its method:

```swift
class MyOpenSubclass: MyOpenClass {
    override func myOpenMethod() {
        super.myOpenMethod()
        // Additional code implementation
    }
}
```
  
In this case, the `MyOpenSubclass` inherits from `MyOpenClass` and overrides the `myOpenMethod()`. Since `MyOpenClass` is marked as `open`, it can be subclassed and its methods overridden.

## Summary

Understanding access levels in Swift is crucial for building scalable and maintainable applications. The `open` access level is the highest level, allowing entities to be accessed, subclassed, and overridden from external modules. By leveraging the right access level, you can ensure the proper encapsulation and modularity of your code while promoting code reuse and extensibility.
