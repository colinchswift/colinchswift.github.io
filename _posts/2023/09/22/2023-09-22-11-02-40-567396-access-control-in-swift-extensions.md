Extensions in Swift allow you to add new functionality to existing classes, structures, or enumerations. They allow you to extend the behavior of a type without subclassing it. However, when defining extensions, it is crucial to understand access control rules to ensure proper encapsulation and data hiding.

## Default Access Levels

By default, types, properties, and methods in Swift have internal access, meaning they can be accessed from anywhere within the same module. When defining an extension, it inherits the access level from the type being extended. For example, if you're extending a public class, the extension's members will also have public access.

## Access Control Modifiers in Extensions

To explicitly specify the access level of an extension's members, you can use access control modifiers in Swift. There are three access control modifiers: *private*, *internal*, and *public*. Here's how they can be used in extensions:

### 1. Private Access

When a member of an extension is marked as *private*, it can only be accessed within the same file. This access level allows you to encapsulate implementation details that should not be visible outside.

```swift
class MyClass {
    private var privateVariable = 10
}

extension MyClass {
    private func privateFunction() {
        // Can only be accessed within the same file
        privateVariable = 20
    }
}
```

### 2. Internal Access

*Internal* access represents the default access level if no access control modifier is specified. It allows members to be accessed within the same module. This access level is useful when extending types within the same framework or app.

```swift
public struct MyStruct {
    internal var internalVariable = 10
}

extension MyStruct {
    internal func internalFunction() {
        // Can be accessed within the same module
        internalVariable = 20
    }
}
```

### 3. Public Access

*Public* access is the highest level of access control and allows members to be accessed from any source file that imports the module. This access level is useful when extending types that need to be accessible outside the module.

```swift
public class MyPublicClass {
    public var publicVariable = 10
}

extension MyPublicClass {
    public func publicFunction() {
        // Can be accessed from any source file that imports the module
        publicVariable = 20
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

When extending types, it is recommended to follow these best practices for access control:

1. Use the least restrictive access level necessary to accomplish the task at hand.
2. Avoid making extension members more accessible than the original type's members.
3. Consider using access control modifiers to further restrict access in extensions when needed, to enforce encapsulation.

By understanding and using access control modifiers effectively, you can ensure proper encapsulation and data hiding while extending types in Swift.
