Access control is an important aspect of software development, especially when it comes to handling sensitive data. In Swift, you can apply access control to database queries to ensure that only authorized users can access and manipulate the data.

## Why Access Control is Important

Access control ensures that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized individuals or systems. It helps prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and security vulnerabilities. By applying access control to database queries, you can enforce restrictions on who can read, write, or modify the data stored in a database.

## Implementing Access Control in Swift

To apply access control to database queries in Swift, you can take advantage of the query builder pattern and implement different levels of access based on user roles or permissions.

### Define User Roles and Permissions

The first step is to define user roles and permissions. For example, you may have roles like "admin," "user," and "guest." Each role would have different levels of access to the database queries.

### Create Access Control Functions

Next, you can create access control functions that encapsulate the database queries. These functions will check the user's role or permission before executing the query. If the user has the necessary access, the query will be executed; otherwise, an error or exception can be thrown.

```swift
func getUserData(userId: String, currentUser: User) throws -> UserData {
    guard currentUser.role == .admin || currentUser.id == userId else {
        throw AccessError.insufficientPermissions
    }
    
    // Execute the query to fetch user data
    // ...
}

func updateUserRole(userId: String, newRole: UserRole, currentUser: User) throws {
    guard currentUser.role == .admin else {
        throw AccessError.insufficientPermissions
    }
    
    // Execute the query to update user role
    // ...
}
```

### Handle Access Errors

In the access control functions, you can define custom error types to handle access errors. This can be helpful for providing specific error messages or logging unauthorized access attempts.

```swift
enum AccessError: Error {
    case insufficientPermissions
    case unauthorizedAccess
}
```

### Usage Example

Here's an example of how you can use the access control functions in your code:

```swift
let currentUser = User(id: "user123", role: .admin)

do {
    let userData = try getUserData(userId: "user456", currentUser: currentUser)
    // Process the retrieved user data
} catch AccessError.insufficientPermissions {
    // Handle insufficient permissions error
} catch AccessError.unauthorizedAccess {
    // Handle unauthorized access error
} catch {
    // Handle other errors
}
```

## Conclusion

Applying access control to database queries in Swift helps protect sensitive data and ensures that only authorized users can interact with it. By defining user roles and permissions, creating access control functions, and handling access errors, you can enforce restrictions on data access and improve the security of your application.
