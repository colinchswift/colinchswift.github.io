## 1. Open

The highest access level in Swift is `open`. Entities marked as `open` can be accessed and subclassed by code outside the module. This level is typically used for frameworks or libraries where you want to provide customization and extension points for other developers. However, `open` access level is not recommended for regular app development as it can introduce potential risks and make code harder to maintain.

## 2. Public

The `public` access level allows entities to be accessed from any source file within the module and outside the module if the module is imported. It is suitable for creating interfaces that are part of a module's public API. However, it is important to note that even though `public` is less permissive than `open`, it still allows external code to access and modify the entity.

## 3. Internal

The `internal` access level is the default level and allows entities to be accessed within the module where they are defined. It is not accessible from outside the module. This level is commonly used for separating the public API from internal implementations. By keeping internal details hidden, you can ensure better encapsulation and reduce coupling between different parts of the codebase.

## 4. File-private

The `fileprivate` access level restricts the visibility of an entity to the file it is declared in. It is useful when you want to hide implementation details and ensure that only a specific file can access or modify the entity. This level helps in achieving strong encapsulation and separation of concerns within a single file.

## 5. Private

The `private` access level is the most restrictive level and restricts the visibility of an entity to the enclosing declaration or scope. It is useful when you want to limit the usage of an entity to a specific block of code, such as a function or a closure. `Private` access level helps in encapsulating implementation details and prevents unintended access or modification.

Using the appropriate access level for your code entities is essential for writing clean, maintainable, and secure code. By properly managing access levels, you can enforce good design practices, protect sensitive data, and promote modular development.

Understanding the access levels in Swift (#SwiftAccessLevels #SwiftProgramming) is crucial for developing well-designed and secure applications. It allows for better encapsulation, separation of concerns, and modular design. Mastering access levels in Swift will enable you to write cleaner and more maintainable code.
