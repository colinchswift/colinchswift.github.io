Logging is an essential part of the development process. It helps us track and debug our code, providing valuable insights into the flow and behavior of our application. However, logging sensitive information or allowing unauthorized access to the logging system can pose security risks. In Swift, we can apply access control modifiers to our logging functions to ensure that only authorized code can access them.

## Understanding Access Control in Swift

Before we dive into applying access control to logging, let's understand the access control modifiers available in Swift:

1. `public`: Public entities can be accessed by any source file in the module or by any module that imports the module.

2. `internal`: Internal entities can be accessed by any source file in the module but not by modules that import the module.

3. `fileprivate`: File-private entities can only be accessed within the same file in which they are defined.

4. `private`: Private entities can only be accessed within the enclosing declaration.

## Applying Access Control to Logging Functions

To ensure that only authorized parts of our code can log information, we can apply access control modifiers to our logging functions. Here's an example of a logging function protected with `private` access control:

```swift
private func log(message: String) {
    // Perform logging logic here
    print(message)
}
```

In this example, the `log` function is marked as `private`, so it can only be accessed within the same context where it is defined. This ensures that only code within the same class or struct can access and use the logging function.

If we want to allow broader access, we can use the `fileprivate` or `internal` access control modifiers instead. For example:

```swift
internal func log(message: String) {
    print(message)
}
```

Here, the `log` function can be accessed by any code within the module but is still restricted from external modules.

## Controlling Access to Logging Depending on User Roles

In some cases, we might want to log different information based on the user's role in the application. In such scenarios, we can utilize Swift's access control modifiers along with conditionals to control the specific logging behavior. 

For example, let's say we have an administrator role that requires more detailed logging. We can modify our logging function as follows:

```swift
private func log(message: String, isAdmin: Bool) {
    if isAdmin {
        print("[ADMIN LOG] \(message)")
    } else {
        print(message)
    }
}
```

Here, the logging function now takes an additional parameter `isAdmin`, which determines if the user has administrator access. If the user is an administrator, the log message is prefixed with `"[ADMIN LOG]"`. Otherwise, it behaves as a regular logging function.

## Conclusion

By applying access control modifiers to logging functions in Swift, we can ensure that only authorized code can access and use the logging functionality. This helps protect sensitive information and improve the security of our applications. Additionally, by combining access control with conditional statements, we can customize the logging behavior based on user roles or other conditions.
