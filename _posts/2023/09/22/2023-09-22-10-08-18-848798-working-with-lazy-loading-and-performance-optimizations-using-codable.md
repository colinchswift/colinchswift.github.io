In modern mobile app development, performance is a crucial aspect to consider. With the increasing complexity of data models and the need to handle large amounts of data, it's important to optimize how we load and parse that data.

In this blog post, we'll explore how to use lazy loading and performance optimizations with the Codable framework in Swift.

## Lazy Loading

Lazy loading is a technique that defers the loading of data until it is actually needed. This can be especially useful when dealing with large or complex data structures, as it allows us to only load and process the data that is currently required.

To implement lazy loading in Swift, we can take advantage of the `lazy` keyword. By marking a property as lazy, we ensure that it is only initialized when accessed for the first time. Let's take a look at an example:

```swift
struct User {
    let id: Int
    let name: String
    lazy var avatar: UIImage = {
        // Load the image from a remote server or a local cache
        let image = loadImageFromNetworkOrCache()
        return image
    }()
}
```

In this example, the `avatar` property is declared as lazy. The image will only be loaded when it is accessed for the first time. This can be extremely useful when dealing with lists or collections of data, where not all properties need to be loaded immediately.

## Performance Optimizations with Codable

Codable is a powerful framework in Swift that allows us to easily serialize and deserialize data to and from different formats, such as JSON or Property List. While Codable provides a convenient way to work with data, it's important to consider performance optimizations when dealing with large datasets.

Here are a few tips to optimize the performance of Codable:

1. Use key strategies: Codable provides a way to map the properties of a data model to the keys in the encoded data. By using custom key strategies, such as `convertFromSnakeCase`, we can improve the performance by automatically transforming the keys. 

2. Split large data models: If your data model contains a large number of properties, consider splitting it into smaller models. This can improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be loaded and processed at once.

3. Use lazy properties: As mentioned earlier, lazy loading can be beneficial when dealing with large data models. Use lazy properties to only load and process the data that is currently needed.

4. Configure date decoding strategy: If your data model includes date properties, consider configuring a specific date decoding strategy to improve performance. By specifying the strategy as `.iso8601`, Codable can optimize the parsing of date strings.

By implementing these performance optimizations, you can ensure that your app loads and processes data efficiently, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.
