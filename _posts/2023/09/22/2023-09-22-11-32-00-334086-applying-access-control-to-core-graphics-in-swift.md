## Access Control in Swift

Access control in Swift allows us to restrict the access to our code entities, such as classes, variables, and functions, based on their visibility and permissions. This helps in maintaining code integrity, preventing unauthorized modifications or access.

In the case of Core Graphics, which provides powerful graphics rendering capabilities, applying access control is crucial. It prevents unintended changes to graphical elements and ensures that only authorized code can perform graphic operations.

## Access Control Levels

Swift provides five access control levels, ranging from the most restrictive to the least restrictive:

1. `private`: Limits the visibility to the entity within the same file.
2. `fileprivate`: Limits the visibility to the entity within the same file and any extensions of the same file.
3. `internal`: Allows access to the entity within the same module (framework or app).
4. `public`: Allows access to the entity from any module that imports the module where the entity is defined.
5. `open`: Similar to `public`, but also allows sub-classing and overriding.

## Applying Access Control to Core Graphics

To apply access control to Core Graphics in Swift, we can use a combination of the access control levels mentioned above and proper encapsulation techniques.

Let's consider an example where we have a custom `DrawingCanvas` class that encapsulates a `CGContext` object:

```swift
public class DrawingCanvas {
    fileprivate var context: CGContext
    
    public func drawLine(from startPoint: CGPoint, to endPoint: CGPoint) {
        // Access the context and perform graphics operations
        context.move(to: startPoint)
        context.addLine(to: endPoint)
        context.strokePath()
    }
}
```

In this example, we have used the `fileprivate` access control level for the `context` property. This restricts its access to the same file and any extensions of the same file, ensuring that only authorized code within the file can manipulate the graphics context.

The `drawLine(from:to:)` method, on the other hand, is defined as `public`. This means that it can be accessed from any module that imports the module in which the `DrawingCanvas` class is defined. Other modules can use this method to perform drawing operations on the canvas, but they won't have direct access to the `context` property.

## Conclusion

By applying access control to Core Graphics in Swift, we can ensure the security and integrity of our graphical operations. Through proper encapsulation and choosing appropriate access control levels, we can restrict access to Core Graphics entities, preventing unauthorized modifications or access.

Remember to always analyze your application's requirements and choose the access control levels that best fit your needs in terms of security, modularity, and extensibility.
