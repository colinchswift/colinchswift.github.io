In Swift, access control determines the scope and visibility of your code. It allows you to restrict the accessibility of your types (classes, structs, enums, or protocols) and their members (properties, methods, initializers, etc.). One of the powerful features of access control in Swift is the ability to define nested types and control their accessibility.

## Nested Types

Nested types are types that are declared inside another type. They can be useful to organize and encapsulate related functionality within a larger type. In Swift, you can declare nested types within classes, structs, or enums.

Let's consider a scenario where we have a `Person` struct and want to define a nested `Address` struct inside it:

```swift
struct Person {
    var name: String
    var age: Int

    struct Address {
        var street: String
        var city: String
        var country: String
    }
}
```

In the example above, we have a `Person` struct that contains two properties: `name` and `age`. Inside the `Person` struct, we define another struct called `Address`. The `Address` struct has its own properties: `street`, `city`, and `country`.

## Access Control for Nested Types

As with any other type, you can apply access control modifiers to nested types to define their visibility:

- `public` - The nested type can be accessed from anywhere, both within and outside the defining type. It can also be subclassed or overridden if it's a class.
- `internal` (default) - The nested type is accessible within the same module (target or framework) where it's defined.
- `private` - The nested type is only accessible within the scope of the defining type.

You can specify the access control level for a nested type using the appropriate keyword before the type declaration. For example:

```swift
public class Vehicle {
    
    private struct Engine {
        // ...
    }
    
    internal enum Transmission {
        // ...
    }
}
```

In the above code, the `Vehicle` class has a private `Engine` struct and an internal `Transmission` enum.

## Conclusion

Access control in Swift allows you to define nested types with specific access levels, providing better encapsulation and organization of your code. By applying access control modifiers, you can control the visibility and accessibility of nested types within your types.

Next time you design your Swift code, consider using nested types and access control to create a more structured and secure application.
