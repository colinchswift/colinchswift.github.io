One of the powerful features in iOS development is the ability to **embed ViewControllers** within another ViewController using container views. This allows us to create modular and reusable user interface components.

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to embed ViewControllers inside a container view in Swift. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Create a Container View

First, we need to add a container view to our parent ViewController. Open your storyboard file and drag a **Container View** from the object library onto the desired location in your ViewController.

## Step 2: Create a Child ViewController

Next, we need to create a new ViewController that will be embedded within the container view. Create a new Swift file for this ViewController, or use an existing one if you have.

## Step 3: Connect the Container View with the Child ViewController

Once you have your child ViewController ready, go back to the storyboard and select the container view. In the **Identity inspector**, set the **Custom Class** property to your child ViewController class.

## Step 4: Embed the Child ViewController

To embed the child ViewController inside the container view, control-drag from the container view to the child ViewController. This will create a **relationship segue** between the two ViewControllers.

## Step 5: Configure the Child ViewController

Finally, we need to do some configuration to display the child ViewController properly. In the **prepareForSegue** method of your parent ViewController, you can access the embedded ViewController using the segue's **destinationViewController** property. From there, you can pass any necessary data or perform any initial setup.

```swift
override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
    if segue.identifier == "EmbedSegue" {
        if let childViewController = segue.destination as? ChildViewController {
            // Configure the child ViewController here
            childViewController.property = value
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

By embedding ViewControllers inside a container view, we can create complex and modular UI components in our iOS apps. This allows us to separate and reuse different parts of our user interface, making our code more maintainable and easier to understand.

Now that you know how to embed ViewControllers inside a container view in Swift, you can explore more advanced features like implementing navigation between embedded ViewControllers or creating custom transitions.
