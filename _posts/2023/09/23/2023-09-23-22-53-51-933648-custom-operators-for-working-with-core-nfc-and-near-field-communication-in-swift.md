In this blog post, we will explore how to create custom operators in Swift for working with Core NFC and Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. Custom operators can help simplify and enhance the readability of your NFC code by providing a more expressive and concise syntax. 

## What is Core NFC and Near Field Communication?

Core NFC is a framework introduced in iOS 11 that allows iPhone apps to read NFC tags and interact with NFC-enabled devices. NFC is a technology that enables two devices to communicate and exchange data when they are placed close together, usually within a few centimeters.

## Creating Custom Operators for NFC in Swift

To create custom operators for working with NFC in Swift, we can leverage the power of operator overloading. Operator overloading allows us to define new behaviors for existing operators or create entirely new operators.

To start, let's define a custom operator for detecting and reading NFC tags:

```swift
infix operator ~>: AdditionPrecedence

func ~>(tagReader: NFCTagReader, completion: @escaping (Tag) -> Void) {
    tagReader.readTag { tag in
        completion(tag)
    }
}
```

In this example, we define the operator `~>` that takes an `NFCTagReader` instance on the left-hand side and a completion closure on the right-hand side. This operator allows us to read an NFC tag and execute the completion closure with the retrieved tag.

Here's how we can use our custom operator:

```swift
let tagReader = NFCTagReader()
tagReader ~> { tag in
    print("Tag read: \(tag)")
}
```

The `~>` operator provides a more expressive syntax for reading NFC tags and handling the resulting data.

## Custom Operators for NFC Operations

We can also define custom operators for other NFC operations, such as writing data to NFC tags or performing secure NFC transactions. Here's an example of a custom operator for writing data to an NFC tag:

```swift
infix operator <~+: AdditionPrecedence

func <~+(tagWriter: NFCTagWriter, data: Data) {
    tagWriter.writeData(data)
}
```

This operator takes an `NFCTagWriter` instance on the left-hand side and a `Data` object on the right-hand side. It writes the provided data to the NFC tag.

Here's an example of using the custom operator:

```swift
let tagWriter = NFCTagWriter()
let data = Data()
tagWriter <~+ data
```

Custom operators like `<~+` provide a more concise and readable syntax for performing NFC operations.

## Conclusion

Custom operators can greatly enhance the readability and expressiveness of your code when working with Core NFC and Near Field Communication in Swift. By using custom operators, you can create a more intuitive and concise syntax for interacting with NFC tags and performing NFC operations. Make sure to use these operators judiciously and document them clearly to ensure maintainability and readability of your codebase.
