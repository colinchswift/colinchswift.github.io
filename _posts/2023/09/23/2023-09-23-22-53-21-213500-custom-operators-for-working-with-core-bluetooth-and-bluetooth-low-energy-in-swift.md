## Introduction
Core Bluetooth is a framework provided by Apple that allows developers to work with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices in their iOS and macOS applications. While Core Bluetooth provides a comprehensive set of APIs, it can sometimes be tedious to write code for common operations. In this blog post, we will explore how to create custom operators in Swift to simplify working with Core Bluetooth and BLE devices.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you will need basic knowledge of Swift and familiarity with Core Bluetooth concepts like central and peripheral managers, services, and characteristics.

## Creating Custom Operators
Custom operators in Swift allow developers to define new symbols or combinations of symbols that can be used to perform specific operations. Developers can define the behavior and precedence of these operators to tailor them for a specific use case. Let's see how we can create custom operators for Core Bluetooth.

### Operator for Reading Characteristic Values
One common operation in Core Bluetooth is reading the value of a characteristic from a peripheral. Let's create a custom operator called `>>` that will streamline this operation. Here's how we can define this operator:

```swift
infix operator >>: AdditionPrecedence

func >><T: ExpressibleByStringLiteral>(characteristic: CBCharacteristic, completion: @escaping (T?) -> Void) {
    // Perform the read operation using the provided characteristic
    characteristic.service?.peripheral?.readValue(for: characteristic)
    
    // Retrieve the value of the characteristic and call the completion handler
    if let value = characteristic.value {
        let typedValue = value.withUnsafeBytes { $0.load(as: T.self) }
        completion(typedValue)
    } else {
        completion(nil)
    }
}
```

In the code above, we define the `>>` operator as an infix operator with a precedence level of `AdditionPrecedence`. The operator takes a `CBCharacteristic` object as the left-hand side operand and a completion handler as the right-hand side operand. Inside the operator's implementation, we perform the read operation on the provided characteristic using the peripheral associated with the characteristic's service. Then, we retrieve the value of the characteristic and call the completion handler with the typed value.

### Usage Example
Now that we have created the `>>` operator, let's see how we can use it in a sample Core Bluetooth application:

```swift
let characteristic: CBCharacteristic = ...

characteristic >> { (value: String?) in
    guard let value = value else {
        print("Failed to read characteristic value")
        return
    }
    
    // Process the characteristic value
    print("Characteristic value: \(value)")
}
```

In the code above, we create a `CBCharacteristic` object and use the `>>` operator to initiate a read operation. We specify the expected type of the value (`String` in this case) in the completion handler. Inside the completion handler, we check if the value is `nil` and handle the failure case accordingly. If the value is not `nil`, we can process it further.

## Conclusion
By creating custom operators in Swift, we can simplify common operations in Core Bluetooth and make our code more expressive. In this blog post, we explored how to create a custom operator for reading values of characteristics from a peripheral. Feel free to extend this concept and create more custom operators to streamline other operations in your Core Bluetooth applications.
