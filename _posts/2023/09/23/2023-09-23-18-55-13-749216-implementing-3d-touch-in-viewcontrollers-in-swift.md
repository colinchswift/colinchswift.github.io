In this tutorial, we will learn how to implement 3D Touch in ViewControllers using Swift. 3D Touch is a powerful feature on newer iPhones that allows users to interact with their apps in a more versatile and intuitive way.

## Prerequisites ##

To follow along with this tutorial, you should have:

- A basic understanding of Swift and iOS development
- Xcode installed on your machine

## Step 1: Enable 3D Touch ##

The first step is to enable 3D Touch in your Xcode project. Open your project in Xcode, go to the target settings, and under the "Capabilities" tab, find "3D Touch" and enable it.

## Step 2: Detecting 3D Touch ##

To detect a 3D Touch on a specific `UIViewController`, we need to override the `traitCollection` property and implement the `traitCollectionDidChange(_:)` method. Here's an example:

```swift
class MyViewController: UIViewController {

    override var traitCollection: UITraitCollection {
        if UIApplication.shared.keyWindow?.traitCollection.forceTouchCapability == .available {
            return UITraitCollection(traitsFrom: [super.traitCollection,
                                                   UITraitCollection(forceTouchCapability: .available)])
        }
        return super.traitCollection
    }

    override func traitCollectionDidChange(_ previousTraitCollection: UITraitCollection?) {
        super.traitCollectionDidChange(previousTraitCollection)
        
        if traitCollection.forceTouchCapability == .available {
            // 3D Touch is available
            registerForPreviewing(with: self, sourceView: view)
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we override the `traitCollection` property to check if the device supports 3D Touch. If it does, we register the `MyViewController` for previewing.

## Step 3: Implement Peek and Pop ##

Once we have registered the `ViewController` for previewing, we can implement the peek and pop functionality. To do this, we need to conform to the `UIViewControllerPreviewingDelegate` protocol and implement its required methods.

```swift
extension MyViewController: UIViewControllerPreviewingDelegate {

    func previewingContext(_ previewingContext: UIViewControllerPreviewing, viewControllerForLocation location: CGPoint) -> UIViewController? {
        guard let previewViewController = storyboard?.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "PreviewViewController") as? PreviewViewController else {
            return nil
        }
        
        // Configure the preview view controller
        previewViewController.data = // Pass necessary data
        
        previewingContext.sourceRect = // Set source rect
        
        return previewViewController
    }
    
    func previewingContext(_ previewingContext: UIViewControllerPreviewing, commit viewControllerToCommit: UIViewController) {
        show(viewControllerToCommit, sender: self)
    }
}
```

In the `previewingContext(_:viewControllerForLocation:)` method, we can create and configure a preview view controller, and in the `previewingContext(_:commit:)` method, we specify the action to be performed when the user commits the preview.

## Conclusion ##

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented 3D Touch in ViewControllers using Swift. Make sure to test your app on a device that supports 3D Touch to see the full functionality. Experiment with different gestures and interactions to enhance the user experience.
