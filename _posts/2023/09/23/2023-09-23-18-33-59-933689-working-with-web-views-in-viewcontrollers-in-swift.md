Web views are an essential component in many iOS applications, allowing you to display web content within your app. In this blog post, we will explore how to work with web views in ViewControllers using Swift.

## Adding a Web View in a ViewController

To add a web view in a ViewController, follow these steps:

1. Open your ViewController in Xcode's Interface Builder.
2. Drag and drop a Web View element from the Object Library onto your ViewController.
3. Resize and position the web view to your desired location within the ViewController.

## Loading a Web Page

To load a web page into the web view, you can use the `loadRequest` method. Here's an example code snippet:

```swift
import UIKit
import WebKit

class MyViewController: UIViewController, WKNavigationDelegate {

    var webView: WKWebView!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Create a WKWebView instance
        webView = WKWebView(frame: view.bounds)
        webView.navigationDelegate = self

        // Load a web page
        if let url = URL(string: "https://www.example.com") {
            webView.load(URLRequest(url: url))
        }

        // Add the web view as a subview to your ViewController's view
        view.addSubview(webView)
    }

    // Implement WKNavigationDelegate methods as per your requirements
    // ...

}
```

## Handling Web View Navigation

You can implement the `WKNavigationDelegate` methods to handle various navigation events in your web view. For example, you can show a loading indicator while the web page is being loaded and handle error conditions.

Here's an example implementation of the `WKNavigationDelegate` methods:

```swift
extension MyViewController {
    // MARK: - WKNavigationDelegate
    
    func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, didStartProvisionalNavigation navigation: WKNavigation!) {
        // Show a loading indicator
        // ...
    }

    func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, didFinish navigation: WKNavigation!) {
        // Hide the loading indicator
        // ...
    }

    func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, didFail navigation: WKNavigation!, withError error: Error) {
        // Handle error conditions, e.g., show an error message
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to add and load web views in ViewControllers using Swift. We have also explored how to handle web view navigation events using the `WKNavigationDelegate` protocol. By understanding these concepts, you can integrate web content seamlessly into your iOS applications.
