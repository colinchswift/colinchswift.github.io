In iOS, handling orientation changes in ViewControllers is essential to provide a seamless user experience across different device orientations. When the user rotates their device, the ViewController needs to adjust its content and layout accordingly.

To handle orientation changes, we can override the `viewWillTransition(to:with:)` method in our ViewController. This method is called right before the rotation starts. Within this method, we can update our UI elements and perform any necessary layout changes.

```swift
override func viewWillTransition(to size: CGSize, with coordinator: UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinator) {
    super.viewWillTransition(to: size, with: coordinator)

    coordinator.animate(alongsideTransition: { _ in
        // Update UI elements and layout
    }) { _ in
        // Completion block after the animation
    }
}
```

Inside the completion block, we can perform any additional tasks that need to be done after the rotation animation completes.

It's important to note that when handling orientation changes, we need to consider both the portrait and landscape orientations. We can use the `size` parameter to determine the new size of the ViewController's view after rotation. We can then update our UI elements based on the new size to ensure they fit properly within the new orientation.

Additionally, if we need to make different layout adjustments for portrait and landscape orientations, we can check the `size` parameter's width and height values to determine the current orientation.

```swift
override func viewWillTransition(to size: CGSize, with coordinator: UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinator) {
    super.viewWillTransition(to: size, with: coordinator)

    if size.width > size.height {
        // Landscape orientation
    } else {
        // Portrait orientation
    }

    coordinator.animate(alongsideTransition: { _ in
        // Update UI elements and layout
    }) { _ in
        // Completion block after the animation
    }
}
```

By handling orientation changes in our ViewControllers, we can ensure that our app's user interface adapts smoothly to different device orientations, providing an optimal user experience.
