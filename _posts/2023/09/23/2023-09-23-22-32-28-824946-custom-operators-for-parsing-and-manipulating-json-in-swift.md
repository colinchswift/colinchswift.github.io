Swift is a powerful language when it comes to working with JSON data. It offers built-in support for JSON serialization and deserialization through the Codable protocol. However, sometimes we need custom operators to perform specific tasks on JSON data. In this article, we will explore how to create custom operators for parsing and manipulating JSON in Swift.

## Parsing JSON with Custom Operators

Parsing JSON in Swift can be cumbersome and tedious, especially when dealing with nested structures. Custom operators can simplify the code and make it more readable. Let's create a custom operator called `??` that provides a default value if a JSON key is missing or has a null value.

```swift
infix operator ??

func ??<T>(lhs: T?, rhs: T) -> T {
    return lhs ?? rhs
}

func parseUser(from json: [String: Any]) -> User {
    let name = json["name"] as? String ?? ""
    let age = json["age"] as? Int ?? 0
    let email = json["email"] as? String ?? ""
    
    return User(name: name, age: age, email: email)
}
```

In the example above, we define the custom operator `??` which takes an optional value `lhs` and a default value `rhs`. It returns `lhs` if it's not nil, otherwise it returns `rhs`. This operator allows us to provide default values for optional JSON properties, avoiding the need for multiple `if let` statements.

## Manipulating JSON with Custom Operators

Custom operators can also be useful for manipulating JSON data. Let's create a custom operator called `+` that concatenates two JSON dictionaries.

```swift
infix operator +

func +(lhs: [String: Any], rhs: [String: Any]) -> [String: Any] {
    var result = lhs
    
    for (key, value) in rhs {
        result[key] = value
    }
    
    return result
}

let json1: [String: Any] = ["name": "John", "age": 25]
let json2: [String: Any] = ["email": "john@example.com", "city": "New York"]

let mergedJSON = json1 + json2
print(mergedJSON)
```

In the example above, we define the custom operator `+` which takes two JSON dictionaries `lhs` and `rhs`, and returns a new dictionary containing the merged values. This operator allows us to easily combine multiple JSON dictionaries into a single one.

## Conclusion

Custom operators can greatly enhance the flexibility and readability of working with JSON in Swift. Whether it's parsing data or manipulating JSON structures, custom operators can simplify the code and make it more expressive. By leveraging these operators, we can write cleaner and more concise JSON handling code in our Swift projects.
