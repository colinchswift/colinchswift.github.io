Swift provides a powerful and expressive way to work with Core Graphics and vector graphics. However, there are times when you might find yourself repeatedly performing similar tasks or writing lengthy code to achieve certain operations. In such cases, creating custom operators can greatly simplify your code and improve readability.

In this blog post, we will explore creating custom operators in Swift that specifically target working with Core Graphics and vector graphics.

## What are custom operators?

Custom operators in Swift allow you to define your own operators to perform custom operations on your data types. They can be a combination of existing operators or completely new symbols that you define.

## Defining custom operators

To define a custom operator, you need to use the `operator` keyword. Let's consider an example where we want to create a custom operator to scale a `CGSize` by a given factor:

```swift
infix operator ** : MultiplicationPrecedence

func **(size: CGSize, scale: CGFloat) -> CGSize {
    return CGSize(width: size.width * scale, height: size.height * scale)
}
```

In this example, we define the operator `**` with the `infix` keyword and specify the `MultiplicationPrecedence` to determine the operator's precedence. We then define a function that performs the scaling operation.

## Usage of custom operators

Once you have defined a custom operator, you can use it as if it were a built-in operator. Let's see how we can use our custom operator to scale a `CGSize`:

```swift
let size = CGSize(width: 100, height: 200)
let scaledSize = size ** 2.0
print(scaledSize) // Output: (200.0, 400.0)
```

In this example, the `**` operator is used to scale the `size` by a factor of 2.0, resulting in a `scaledSize` of (200.0, 400.0).

## Benefits of custom operators for Core Graphics and vector graphics

By creating custom operators for Core Graphics and vector graphics operations, you can make your code more concise and expressive. This can drastically improve the readability and maintainability of your codebase.

Some common use cases for custom operators in this context include transformations, blending modes, geometric calculations, and more.

## Conclusion

Custom operators provide a convenient way to work with Core Graphics and vector graphics in Swift by allowing you to express complex operations in a concise and readable manner. By creating your own operators, you can enhance the expressiveness of your code and reduce repetition.

Remember to use custom operators judiciously and document their usage properly to ensure clarity for yourself and other developers working with your code.
