In Swift, the range operator `...` and `..<` are commonly used to create ranges of values. However, you can also create your own custom range operator to suit your specific needs. In this blog post, we will explore how to create a custom range operator in Swift.

## What is a Range Operator?

Range operators in Swift allow you to represent a range of values. The `...` operator represents a closed range, where both the start and end values are inclusive. On the other hand, the `..<` operator represents a half-open range, where the start value is inclusive, but the end value is exclusive.

## Creating a Custom Range Operator

To create a custom range operator, you need to define a custom type that conforms to the `RangeExpression` protocol. The `RangeExpression` protocol requires you to implement two methods: `relative(to:)` and `contains(_:)`.

Here's an example of a custom range operator that represents an open range (exclusive on both ends):

```swift
struct CustomRangeOperator<T: Comparable>: RangeExpression {
    let lowerBound: T
    let upperBound: T
    
    func relative<C: Collection>(to collection: C) -> Range<T> where C.Element == T {
        let start = collection.firstIndex(of: lowerBound)!
        let end = collection.firstIndex(of: upperBound)!
        return start..<end
    }
    
    func contains(_ element: T) -> Bool {
        return element > lowerBound && element < upperBound
    }
}
```

In the above example, we define a `CustomRangeOperator` struct that takes two generic parameters `T` which must conform to the `Comparable` protocol. We store the lower bound and upper bound values as properties in the struct.

The `relative(to:)` method takes a collection as an argument and returns the range that represents the custom range operator. In this case, we find the indices of the lower and upper bounds in the collection and return a range that starts at the lower bound index and ends at the upper bound index.

The `contains(_:)` method checks if an element falls within the custom range. In our example, we define an open range, so the element should be greater than the lower bound and less than the upper bound to be considered within the range.

## Using the Custom Range Operator

Once you have defined the custom range operator, you can use it like any other range operator in Swift. Here's an example of using our custom range operator with an array of integers:

```swift
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

let customRange = CustomRangeOperator(lowerBound: 3, upperBound: 7)

let filteredNumbers = numbers.filter { customRange.contains($0) }

print(filteredNumbers)
```

In the above example, we define an array of integers `numbers`. We then create an instance of our custom range operator `customRange` with a lower bound of `3` and an upper bound of `7`. We use the `filter` function to filter out the elements from the `numbers` array that fall within the custom range. Finally, we print the filtered numbers.

## Conclusion

Creating a custom range operator in Swift allows you to define your own range semantics that suit your specific requirements. By conforming to the `RangeExpression` protocol, you can create custom range operators that seamlessly integrate with Swift's existing range operators.
