In this blog post, we will explore how to implement document recognition and scanning in ViewControllers using Swift. Document scanning is a commonly used feature in various applications where users need to scan and save documents using their mobile devices. With the advancements in image processing, implementing document scanning has become easier than ever. So let's dive into the code and see how we can achieve this functionality in Swift!

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need:

1. Xcode installed on your macOS machine.
2. Basic knowledge of Swift programming language and UIKit framework.

## Step 1: Set up the UI

First, let's set up the user interface to allow users to capture an image of the document. We will use a `UIImagePickerController` for this purpose. Start by adding a button to trigger the scanning process and an image view to display the captured document.

```swift
import UIKit

class DocumentScannerViewController: UIViewController, UIImagePickerControllerDelegate, UINavigationControllerDelegate {

    // Image view to display the captured document
    @IBOutlet weak var documentImageView: UIImageView!
  
    // Button to trigger the document scanning
    @IBAction func scanDocument(_ sender: UIButton) {
        // TODO: Implement document scanning logic
    }
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Additional setup code
    }
    // Rest of the ViewController code
}
```

## Step 2: Implement document scanning logic

Next, let's implement the logic to scan the document. Inside the `scanDocument` method, we will present a `UIImagePickerController` and configure it for document scanning mode.

```swift
@IBAction func scanDocument(_ sender: UIButton) {
    let imagePicker = UIImagePickerController()
    imagePicker.delegate = self
    imagePicker.sourceType = .camera
    imagePicker.cameraCaptureMode = .photo
    imagePicker.cameraDevice = .rear
    imagePicker.showsCameraControls = true
    imagePicker.allowsEditing = false
    
    // Set the camera capture mode to document scanning
    imagePicker.cameraOverlayView = DocumentScannerOverlayView(frame: self.view.bounds)
    
    present(imagePicker, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

## Step 3: Process the scanned document

After the user captures the document, we need to process and display the scanned image in the `documentImageView` we created earlier. To do this, we will implement the `imagePickerController(_:didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:)` delegate method.

```swift
func imagePickerController(_ picker: UIImagePickerController, didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo info: [UIImagePickerController.InfoKey : Any]) {
    if let pickedImage = info[.originalImage] as? UIImage {
        documentImageView.image = pickedImage
    }
    
    picker.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

## Step 4: Add custom UI overlay (optional)

Additionally, you can enhance the user experience by adding a custom UI overlay on top of the camera view. This allows you to guide the user to capture the document properly. Create a subclass of `UIView` and customize it based on your requirements.

```swift
class DocumentScannerOverlayView: UIView {
    // Customize the overlay view here
    // Add guides, text instructions, or any other UI elements to assist the user
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to implement document recognition and scanning in ViewControllers using Swift. By following these steps, you can easily add document scanning functionality to your application. Remember to handle error cases and permissions appropriately. Feel free to customize the UI and add additional features as per your application's requirements. Now you are ready to empower your users to scan documents directly from your app!
