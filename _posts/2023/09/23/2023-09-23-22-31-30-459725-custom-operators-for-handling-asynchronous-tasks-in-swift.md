Asynchronous programming is becoming increasingly common in Swift development, especially when working with networking requests, database operations, or long-running tasks. The introduction of Combine framework and async/await in Swift 5.5 has made handling asynchronous tasks even more streamlined. However, sometimes it can be helpful to have custom operators to simplify and enhance the readability of asynchronous code.

In this article, we will explore how to create custom operators in Swift to handle asynchronous tasks with ease and improve the overall code readability.

## What are Custom Operators?

Custom operators in Swift allow us to define new symbols or combinations of existing symbols that can be used to perform specific operations. These operators can be applied to any appropriate types based on the operator's definition.

## Custom Operator for Asynchronous Task Execution

Let's start by creating a custom operator that simplifies the execution of asynchronous tasks. We can define a postfix operator, `~>`, which takes a closure that represents an asynchronous task as its operand.

```swift
postfix operator ~>

postfix func ~> <T>(task: @escaping () async throws -> T) async rethrows -> T {
    return try await task()
}
```

With this operator in place, we can now execute asynchronous tasks in a more concise way. Here's an example:

```swift
func fetchUserData() async throws -> UserData {
    // Perform some asynchronous task to fetch user data
    // and return the fetched data.
}

// Usage
let user = try await fetchUserData() ~>
let posts = try await fetchUserPosts() ~>
let comments = try await fetchUserComments() ~>
```

By using the `~>` operator, we eliminate the need for surrounding `try await` every time we want to execute an asynchronous task, making the code more readable.

## Custom Operator for Combining Asynchronous Results

Another common scenario in asynchronous programming is combining the results of multiple asynchronous tasks. Let's create a custom operator, `|>`, that combines the results of two asynchronous tasks.

```swift
infix operator |> : MultiplicationPrecedence

func |> <T, U>(leftTask: @escaping () async throws -> T, rightTask: @escaping (T) async throws -> U) async rethrows -> U {
    let result = try await leftTask()
    return try await rightTask(result)
}
```

With this operator, we can now chain together asynchronous tasks that depend on each other's results. Here's an example:

```swift
// Define asynchronous tasks
func fetchPostCount() async throws -> Int {
    // Perform some asynchronous task to fetch the total post count
}

func fetchPost(with id: Int) async throws -> Post {
    // Perform some asynchronous task to fetch a post with the given id
}

// Usage
let postCountAndPost = try await fetchPostCount() |> fetchPost
```

By using the `|>` operator, we can eliminate unnecessary intermediate variables and create a concise flow of asynchronous operations.

## Conclusion

Custom operators can be a powerful tool for improving the readability and expressiveness of asynchronous code in Swift. By creating operators that align with our specific requirements, we can simplify the execution and combination of asynchronous tasks. However, it's important to use custom operators judiciously and ensure they enhance code readability rather than obfuscating it.

Remember to follow Swift's guidelines for operator definitions and use descriptive names in order to create meaningful and self-explanatory custom operators.
