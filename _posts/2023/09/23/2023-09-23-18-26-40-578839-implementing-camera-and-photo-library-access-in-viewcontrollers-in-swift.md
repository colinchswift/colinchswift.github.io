In many iOS applications, it is common to require access to the camera and photo library to enable users to take photos or choose existing photos from their library. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement camera and photo library access in Swift using ViewControllers.

## 1. Requesting Camera and Photo Library Access

To access the camera and photo library, you need to request the necessary permissions from the user. Start by importing the `AVFoundation` framework at the beginning of your ViewController file:

```swift
import AVFoundation
```

To request camera access, add the following code to your ViewController:

```swift
func requestCameraAccess() {
    AVCaptureDevice.requestAccess(for: .video) { granted in
        if !granted {
            // Handle denied access
        } else {
            // Access granted
        }
    }
}

```

Similarly, to request photo library access, use the following code:

```swift
func requestPhotoLibraryAccess() {
    PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization { status in
        switch status {
        case .authorized:
            // Access granted
            break
        case .denied, .restricted:
            // Handle denied or restricted access
            break
        case .notDetermined:
            // Access not determined yet
            break
        @unknown default:
            break
        }
    }
}
```

## 2. Presenting the Camera and Photo Library

Once you have requested and received the necessary permissions, you can present the camera or photo library to the user. Let's start with the camera.

```swift
func presentCamera() {
    let picker = UIImagePickerController()
    picker.sourceType = .camera
    picker.delegate = self
    present(picker, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

To present the photo library, use the following code:

```swift
func presentPhotoLibrary() {
    let picker = UIImagePickerController()
    picker.sourceType = .photoLibrary
    picker.delegate = self
    present(picker, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

## 3. Handling the Result

To handle the result of the user selecting or capturing a photo, adopt the `UIImagePickerControllerDelegate` and `UINavigationControllerDelegate` protocols in your ViewController class:

```swift
class YourViewController: UIViewController, UIImagePickerControllerDelegate, UINavigationControllerDelegate {
   // ... your code here
}
```

Implement the delegate method to handle the selected photo:

```swift
func imagePickerController(_ picker: UIImagePickerController, didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo info: [UIImagePickerController.InfoKey : Any]) {
    guard let image = info[UIImagePickerController.InfoKey.originalImage] as? UIImage else {
        // Error handling
        return
    }
    
    // Do something with the selected image
    
    picker.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

## Conclusion

Implementing camera and photo library access in ViewControllers allows your iOS applications to provide users with the ability to capture or select photos. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily integrate this feature into your Swift apps. Remember to test your code on different devices and handle any error scenarios to ensure a smooth user experience.
