In iOS development, the status bar is the area at the top of the screen that displays important information such as the time, battery status, and network connectivity. By default, the status bar is displayed with a black background and white text. However, you can easily customize the appearance of the status bar in your ViewControllers to match the style of your app.

To customize the status bar in ViewControllers, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Set the `UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance` to `true` in your `Info.plist` file. This allows each ViewController to control the appearance of the status bar.

Step 2: Open your ViewController file and override the `preferredStatusBarStyle` property. This property returns the style of the status bar that you want for the specific ViewController. 

For example, if you want a light content status bar with white text, you can add the following code to your ViewController:

```swift
override var preferredStatusBarStyle: UIStatusBarStyle {
    return .lightContent
}
```

Step 3: If you want to change the background color of the status bar, you can use the `statusBarFrame` property to get the frame of the status bar and add a subview with the desired background color.

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    
    let statusBarBackgroundView = UIView(frame: UIApplication.shared.statusBarFrame)
    statusBarBackgroundView.backgroundColor = UIColor.red // replace with your desired color
    view.addSubview(statusBarBackgroundView)
}
```

Step 4: Finally, make sure to update the status bar appearance whenever the ViewController's view is displayed by calling `SetNeedsStatusBarAppearanceUpdate()` method.

```swift
override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    super.viewWillAppear(animated)
    
    setNeedsStatusBarAppearanceUpdate()
}
```

And that's it! You have now customized the status bar in your ViewController. Remember to layout and style the subview added in Step 3 according to your app's design.
