In this blog post, we will explore how to leverage Core Spotlight in Swift to integrate search functionality within ViewControllers. Core Spotlight is a powerful framework provided by Apple that allows developers to index and search content within their app.

## What is Core Spotlight?

Core Spotlight is a framework introduced in iOS 9 that enables developers to expose app content to iOS's search functionality. By utilizing Core Spotlight, you can mark specific items within your app and make them searchable from the device's home screen or within other apps that support searching.

## Integrating Core Spotlight in ViewControllers

To integrate Core Spotlight in ViewControllers, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Import Core Spotlight

```swift
import CoreSpotlight
```

### Step 2: Create an Item for Search

To make a particular item within your UIViewController searchable, you need to create an instance of the `CSSearchableItem` class. This class represents an item that can be indexed and searched.

```swift
func createSearchableItem() {
    let item = CSSearchableItem(uniqueIdentifier: "com.example.app.item1", domainIdentifier: "items", attributeSet: generateSearchableItemAttributes())
    CSSearchableIndex.default().indexSearchableItems([item]) { error in
        if let error = error {
            print("Failed to index search item: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    }
}

func generateSearchableItemAttributes() -> CSSearchableItemAttributeSet {
    let attributes = CSSearchableItemAttributeSet(itemContentType: kUTTypeText as String)
    attributes.title = "Item 1"
    attributes.contentDescription = "This is an example searchable item."
    attributes.keywords = ["item", "example"]
    return attributes
}
```

In the above code snippet, `createSearchableItem()` creates an instance of `CSSearchableItem`, assigning it a unique identifier and a domain identifier. The `generateSearchableItemAttributes()` function generates the attributes for the item (e.g., title, content description, and keywords).

### Step 3: Handle User Interaction

To handle user interaction when a search result is selected, implement the following method in your ViewController:

```swift
func restoreUserActivityState(_ activity: NSUserActivity) {
    if activity.activityType == CSSearchableItemActionType {
        if let identifier = activity.userInfo?[CSSearchableItemActivityIdentifier] as? String {
            // Handle the selected item based on its unique identifier
            if identifier == "com.example.app.item1" {
                // Code to handle selection of Item 1
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This method is called whenever the user selects a search result associated with your app. You can extract the unique identifier of the selected item and take appropriate action based on it.

### Step 4: Activate Search Integration

Finally, to enable search integration within your ViewController, register the activity type in your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSUserActivityTypes</key>
<array>
    <string>com.apple.corespotlightitem</string>
    <string>YOUR_ACTIVITY_TYPE</string>
</array>
```

Replace `YOUR_ACTIVITY_TYPE` with a unique identifier for your activity.

## Conclusion

Core Spotlight provides a simple yet powerful way to integrate search functionality within your app. By leveraging Core Spotlight in ViewControllers, you can make your app's content discoverable through iOS's search system. This can greatly enhance the user experience and make your app more accessible.

By following the steps outlined above, you can easily integrate Core Spotlight in your ViewControllers using Swift. With the ability to create searchable items and handle user interactions, you can create a seamless search experience within your app. Start leveraging Core Spotlight today to enhance the discoverability of your app's content.
