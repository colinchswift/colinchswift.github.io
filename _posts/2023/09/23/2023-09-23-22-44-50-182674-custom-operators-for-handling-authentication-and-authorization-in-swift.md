Authentication and authorization are key components of any secure application. In Swift, we can simplify the process of handling these tasks by creating custom operators. Custom operators allow us to define our own syntax for performing specific operations.

In this blog post, we will explore how we can create custom operators in Swift to handle authentication and authorization in a more elegant and readable way. Let's get started!

## Authentication Operator

First, let's define a custom operator that handles authentication. This operator will take a username and password as input and return a boolean value indicating whether the authentication was successful.

```swift
infix operator ~> : AuthenticationPrecedence

precedencegroup AuthenticationPrecedence {
    associativity: left
    higherThan: AdditionPrecedence
    lowerThan: MultiplicationPrecedence
}

func ~> (username: String, password: String) -> Bool {
    // Perform authentication logic here
    // Return true if authentication is successful, false otherwise
    return true
}
```

With this custom operator, we can now authenticate a user by simply using the `~>` operator:

```swift
if "username" ~> "password" {
    // Authentication successful
} else {
    // Authentication failed
}
```

## Authorization Operator

Next, let's define a custom operator that handles authorization. This operator will take a user's role and a required role as input and return a boolean value indicating whether the user is authorized.

```swift
infix operator => : AuthorizationPrecedence

precedencegroup AuthorizationPrecedence {
    associativity: left
    higherThan: AdditionPrecedence
    lowerThan: MultiplicationPrecedence
}

enum UserRole {
    case admin
    case user
}

func => (userRole: UserRole, requiredRole: UserRole) -> Bool {
    // Perform authorization logic here
    // Return true if user is authorized, false otherwise
    return true
}
```

Using the authorization operator, we can now check whether a user is authorized by simply using the `=>` operator:

```swift
let userRole: UserRole = .admin

if userRole => .admin {
    // User is authorized
} else {
    // User is not authorized
}
```

By creating custom operators for authentication and authorization, we can make our code more expressive and easier to read. These operators can be used alongside other Swift language constructs, allowing us to build secure applications with cleaner syntax.
