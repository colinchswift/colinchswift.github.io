One of the powerful frameworks in iOS development is Core Image, which provides a wide range of image processing capabilities. With Core Image, you can apply various filters, such as blur, color adjustment, and more, to enhance or modify images in your ViewControllers.

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to integrate Core Image into a UIViewController and apply some common image filters using Swift.

## Prerequisites
- Xcode installed on your Mac
- Basic knowledge of Swift and iOS development

## Setting up the Project
1. Open Xcode and create a new Single View App project.
2. Name the project "ImageFilters" and set the language to Swift.
3. Choose a location to save the project and select your desired options for source control and testing.

## Adding Core Image to the Project
1. In the Project Navigator, select the target for your app.
2. Go to the "General" tab and scroll down to the "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" section.
3. Click the "+" button and search for "CoreImage".
4. Select "CoreImage.framework" from the search results and click "Add".

## Applying Image Filters in a ViewController
1. Open `ViewController.swift` and import CoreImage at the top of the file:

    ```swift
    import CoreImage
    ```

2. Add an IBOutlet for an image view to your ViewController class:

    ```swift
    @IBOutlet weak var imageView: UIImageView!
    ```

3. Create a function to apply image filters:

    ```swift
    func applyFilters() {
        guard let originalImage = UIImage(named: "sample-image") else { return }
        
        let context = CIContext(options: nil)
        guard let ciImage = CIImage(image: originalImage) else { return }
        
        // Apply filters to the CIImage
        
        if let filter = CIFilter(name: "CIGaussianBlur") {
            filter.setValue(ciImage, forKey: kCIInputImageKey)
            filter.setValue(10, forKey: kCIInputRadiusKey)
            
            if let outputImage = filter.outputImage {
                if let cgImage = context.createCGImage(outputImage, from: outputImage.extent) {
                    let blurredImage = UIImage(cgImage: cgImage)
                    imageView.image = blurredImage
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

4. Call the `applyFilters()` function in `viewDidLoad()` to apply the filters when the view loads:

    ```swift
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        applyFilters()
    }
    ```

5. Open the storyboard file and add an image view to the view controller scene.
6. Connect the image view IBOutlet to the image view in the scene.

## Running the Project
1. Build and run the project on the iOS Simulator or a physical device.
2. You should see the applied image filter on the image view in the ViewController.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to integrate Core Image into a UIViewController and apply image filters using Swift. Core Image provides a rich set of image processing capabilities, and with some creativity, you can create amazing visual effects in your app.

Feel free to explore other available filters and experiment with different parameter values to achieve the desired effects. Remember to import the necessary frameworks and follow the provided code snippets for proper implementation.
