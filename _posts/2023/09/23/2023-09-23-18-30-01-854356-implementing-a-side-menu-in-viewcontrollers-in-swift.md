In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement a side menu in ViewControllers using Swift. A side menu is a popular UI component that allows users to navigate through different sections or features of an application, usually hidden off-screen and revealed by swiping or tapping on a button.

To achieve this, we will use a popular library called `SideMenu`. This library provides an easy way to add a side menu to your app with minimal effort. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Install SideMenu Library

First, we need to install the SideMenu library. Open your project's `Podfile` and add the following line:

```
pod 'SideMenu'
```

Save the file and run `pod install` in the terminal to install the library. Once the installation is complete, make sure to open the newly generated `.xcworkspace` file.

## Step 2: Set up the Side Menu

In your `ViewController`, import the SideMenu library:

```swift
import SideMenu
```

Next, define a function to set up the side menu:

```swift
func setupSideMenu() {
    let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil)
    let contentViewController = storyboard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "ContentViewController")
    
    let menuViewController = storyboard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "MenuViewController")
    
    let sideMenuController = SideMenuController(contentViewController: contentViewController,
                                                menuViewController: menuViewController)
    
    SideMenuManager.default.menuLeftNavigationController = sideMenuController
    SideMenuManager.default.menuPresentMode = .menuSlideIn
}
```

In this example, we assume that you have two view controllers: `ContentViewController` (the main content) and `MenuViewController` (the side menu). Adjust the storyboard identifiers if necessary.

## Step 3: Present the Side Menu

Now, we can present the side menu by adding a button or gesture recognizer in your `ViewController`. For example, add a button to the navigation bar:

```swift
func addSideMenuButton() {
    let button = UIBarButtonItem(image: UIImage(named: "menu-icon"), style: .plain, target: self, action: #selector(showSideMenu))
    navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = button
}

@objc func showSideMenu() {
    present(SideMenuManager.default.menuLeftNavigationController!, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

Here, we have added a button with the image "menu-icon" to the left side of the navigation bar. When tapped, it will present the side menu.

## Step 4: Customize the Side Menu

The `SideMenu` library provides various customization options to customize the appearance and behavior of the side menu. You can customize the menu animation, animation duration, menu width, and more. Please refer to the library's documentation for further details.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented a side menu in ViewControllers using Swift with the help of the SideMenu library. Side menus are a great way to enhance the user experience and provide easy navigation in your app.

Remember to import the SideMenu library, set up the side menu, and present it with a button or gesture recognizer. Customize the side menu according to your app's needs.
