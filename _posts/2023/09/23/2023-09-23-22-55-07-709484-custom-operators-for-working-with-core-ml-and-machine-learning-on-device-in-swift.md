In this blog post, we will explore how to create custom operators in Swift to enhance the functionality of Core ML, Apple's machine learning framework for on-device inference. Custom operators can simplify and streamline code by encapsulating complex operations into a single, concise symbol.

## What are operators?

Operators in Swift are special symbols or tokens that represent specific operations or computations. They provide a concise way to perform common tasks and manipulate data. Swift provides a set of built-in operators, but we can also create custom operators to extend the language's capabilities.

## Creating custom operators for Core ML

1. **Define the operator:**

   To create a custom operator, use the `operator` keyword followed by the `prefix`, `infix`, or `postfix` modifier. For example, let's define a custom operator called `⭐️` (star) that performs element-wise multiplication of two arrays:

   ```swift
   prefix operator ⭐️ // Prefix operator

   prefix func ⭐️(array: [Double]) -> [Double] {
       return array.map { $0 * $0 }
   }
   ```

   This operator multiplies each element in the array by itself and returns a new array.

2. **Import CoreML:**

   To use Core ML in your custom operator, import the `CoreML` framework at the top of your Swift file:

   ```swift
   import CoreML
   ```

3. **Make the custom operator compatible with Core ML types:**

   Core ML uses its own type system for machine learning models. To make the custom operator work seamlessly with Core ML types, conform to the `MLFeatureValueConvertible` protocol. For example, let's modify our previous custom operator to work with Core ML's `MLFeatureValue` type:

   ```swift
   extension Array: MLFeatureValueConvertible where Element == Double {
       public func featureValue() -> MLFeatureValue {
           return MLFeatureValue(doubleArray: self)
       }
   }
   ```

   Now, we can use the `⭐️` operator directly on arrays of type `MLFeatureValue`.

## Using custom operators with Core ML

Once you have defined your custom operators, you can use them along with Core ML to enhance your machine learning workflow. Here's an example:

```swift
import CoreML

// Create an array of doubles
let array = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]

// Apply the custom operator to the array
let result = ⭐️array

// Convert the result to an MLFeatureValue
let featureValue = result.featureValue()

// Print the MLFeatureValue
print(featureValue)
```

The above code applies the custom operator `⭐️` to the array `array`, converts the result to an `MLFeatureValue`, and prints the value.

## Conclusion

Custom operators can be a powerful tool in Swift for working with Core ML and machine learning on-device. They enable us to create more expressive code and streamline our workflow. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can create and use custom operators to enhance your machine learning projects using Core ML.
