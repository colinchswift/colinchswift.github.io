Push notifications are an essential part of modern mobile applications, allowing developers to remotely send messages and alerts to users. In Swift, we can leverage custom operators to simplify the handling of push notifications. Custom operators enable us to create our own symbols and define their behavior when used in our code.

## Why use custom operators for push notifications?

Using custom operators can provide a more declarative and expressive way to handle push notifications in Swift. Rather than relying on traditional function calls or method invocations, custom operators allow us to define our own symbols that match the mental model of handling push notifications.

## Defining the custom operators

To define a custom operator for handling push notifications in Swift, we need to start with the `operator` keyword, followed by the operator name and the desired operator precedence.

```swift
infix operator ~> : AdditionPrecedence
```

Here, we define a custom infix operator `~>` and associate it with the `AdditionPrecedence` precedence group. The `AdditionPrecedence` is just an example - you can choose an appropriate precedence group based on your specific use case.

## Implementing the custom operator

Once we've defined the custom operator, we need to implement its behavior. In the context of push notifications, we can use the custom operator to send and handle notifications. Let's see an example:

```swift
struct PushNotification {
    let title: String
    let message: String
}

func sendNotification(title: String, message: String) {
    // Logic to send the push notification
    let notification = PushNotification(title: title, message: message)
    print("Notification sent - \(notification)")
}

func handleNotification(_ notification: PushNotification) {
    // Logic to handle the push notification
    print("Notification received - \(notification)")
}

infix operator ~> : AdditionPrecedence

@discardableResult
func ~> (title: String, message: String) -> PushNotification {
    sendNotification(title: title, message: message)
    return PushNotification(title: title, message: message)
}

@discardableResult
func ~> (notification: PushNotification, handler: (PushNotification) -> Void) -> PushNotification {
    handler(notification)
    return notification
}

// Usage
"New message" ~> "You have a new message" ~> { notification in
    handleNotification(notification)
}
```

In the example above, we use the custom operator `~>` to chain different operations related to push notifications. The first operator `~>` is used to send a notification, while the second operator `~>` is used to handle the received notification.

## Conclusion

Custom operators can be a powerful tool in Swift, allowing us to create expressive and easy-to-read code. When it comes to handling push notifications, custom operators can provide a more intuitive way to send and handle notifications. By defining our own operators, we can tailor the language syntax to better match our mental model for working with push notifications in Swift.
