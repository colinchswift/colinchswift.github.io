In Swift, operators are an essential part of the language. They provide a way to perform different types of operations, such as arithmetic or comparison, on different types of data. While Swift comes with a set of predefined operators, it also allows you to define your own custom operators.

When defining custom operators in Swift, it is important to consider access control. Access control allows you to restrict the visibility and use of your custom operators to specific parts of your codebase. This ensures that operators are used correctly and as intended.

## Default Access Control for Custom Operators

By default, custom operators in Swift have the same access level as the surrounding context in which they are defined. This means that if you define a custom operator within a type or a module, the access level of that operator will be the same as the access level of the type or module.

For example, if you define a custom operator within a public type, that operator will also have a public access level. On the other hand, if you define a custom operator within a private type, that operator will have a private access level.

## Changing the Access Level of Custom Operators

You can explicitly change the access level of a custom operator using Swift's access modifiers. This allows you to fine-tune the visibility and use of the operator based on your requirements.

To change the access level of a custom operator, you need to use the `public`, `internal`, `fileprivate`, or `private` modifier before the `operator` keyword.

```swift
public operator +++(left: Int, right: Int) -> Int {
    return left + right + 1
}
```

In the example above, we have defined a custom operator `+++` which adds two integers and increments the result by 1. We have explicitly marked this operator as `public`, making it accessible from any module that imports the module where this operator is defined.

## Using Custom Operators

To use a custom operator in your code, you need to make sure that the operator is accessible based on its access level.

```swift
let sum = 5 +++ 3
```

In the above code snippet, we are using the `+++` operator to add 5 and 3, and assigning the result to the constant `sum`. As long as the access level of the custom operator allows it to be used in this context, the code will compile successfully.

## Conclusion

Access control is an important aspect to consider when defining and using custom operators in Swift. By carefully managing the access level of your operators, you can ensure that they are used and accessed correctly across different parts of your codebase.

Custom operators can provide powerful abstractions and improve code readability when used appropriately. However, keep in mind that custom operators should be used sparingly and only when they bring clear benefits and enhance the overall clarity of your codebase.
