One of the ways to enhance the user experience in your iOS app is by implementing animated transitions between ViewControllers. These transitions can add a touch of elegance and make your app feel more polished.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement animated transitions between ViewControllers using Swift.

## Setting up the Project

To get started, create a new Xcode project or open an existing one. We will assume that you have a basic understanding of ViewControllers and how to navigate between them.

## Creating a Transition Manager

The first step is to create a Transition Manager class that will handle the animated transitions between ViewControllers. Create a new Swift file called `TransitionManager.swift` and define the `TransitionManager` class as shown below:

```swift
import UIKit

class TransitionManager: NSObject, UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning {

    func transitionDuration(using transitionContext: UIViewControllerContextTransitioning?) -> TimeInterval {
        return 0.5 // Duration of the transition in seconds
    }

    func animateTransition(using transitionContext: UIViewControllerContextTransitioning) {
        // Implement your custom animation logic here
    }
}
```

## Implementing Container ViewControllers

Next, we need to implement the Container ViewControllers that will be responsible for transitioning between the child ViewControllers. Create a new Swift file called `ContainerViewController.swift` and define the `ContainerViewController` class as shown below:

```swift
import UIKit

class ContainerViewController: UIViewController {

    // MARK: - Private properties

    private var currentViewController: UIViewController?

    // MARK: - Public methods

    func transitionToViewController(_ viewController: UIViewController) {
        guard let currentViewController = currentViewController else {
            addViewController(viewController)
            return
        }

        currentViewController.willMove(toParent: nil)
        addChild(viewController)

        transition(from: currentViewController, to: viewController, duration: 0.5, options: .transitionCrossDissolve, animations: nil) { _ in
            currentViewController.removeFromParent()
            viewController.didMove(toParent: self)
            self.currentViewController = viewController
        }
    }

    // MARK: - Private methods

    private func addViewController(_ viewController: UIViewController) {
        addChild(viewController)

        view.addSubview(viewController.view)
        viewController.view.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
            viewController.view.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor),
            viewController.view.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.trailingAnchor),
            viewController.view.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.topAnchor),
            viewController.view.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.bottomAnchor)
        ])

        viewController.didMove(toParent: self)

        currentViewController = viewController
    }
}
```

## Using the Transition Manager

Finally, we can use the `TransitionManager` class to handle the animated transitions between our ViewControllers. Inside the method where you navigate from one ViewController to another, instantiate an instance of `TransitionManager` and set it as the delegate for the animated transition. Here's an example:

```swift
let transitionManager = TransitionManager()

// Set the delegate for the animated transition
viewController.transitioningDelegate = transitionManager

// Present the ViewController with an animated transition
present(viewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

## Conclusion

By implementing animated transitions between ViewControllers, you can enhance the user experience of your iOS app and make it more engaging. With the help of the `TransitionManager` class, you can easily customize and control the animation logic.

Remember to experiment with different animation techniques and durations to find the transition that best fits your app's design and style.
