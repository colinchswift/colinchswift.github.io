Share extensions allow users to share content from other apps via your app. This feature is particularly useful when you want to integrate your app with social media platforms or enable content sharing from other apps. In this article, we will explore how to implement share extensions in ViewControllers using Swift.

## Step 1: Adding Share Extension Target

1. Open your Xcode project and navigate to the **Project Navigator**.
2. Right-click on your project or the group where you want to add the share extension.
3. Select **New Target** from the contextual menu.
4. Under **iOS > Application Extensions**, select **Share Extension**.
5. Provide a name for the share extension and ensure the appropriate options are selected.
6. Click **Finish** to add the share extension target to your project.

## Step 2: Configuring Share Extension

1. Open the **Info.plist** file of your share extension target.
2. Remove the default value in the **NSExtensionPrincipalClass** key.
3. Add a new key-value pair with the key **NSExtensionPrincipalClass** and the value set to the name of your custom ViewController class.
   
```swift
<key>NSExtensionPrincipalClass</key>
<string>ShareViewController</string>
```

4. Save the **Info.plist** file.

## Step 3: Creating the Share ViewController

1. Create a new Swift file named `ShareViewController.swift`.
2. Make your `ShareViewController` class inherit from `UIViewController` and implement the `UIActivityItemSource` protocol.
   
```swift
import UIKit

class ShareViewController: UIViewController, UIActivityItemSource {
    // Add your implementation here
}
```

3. Implement the required methods of the `UIActivityItemSource` protocol to provide the content to be shared.
   
```swift
func activityViewControllerPlaceholderItem(_ activityViewController: UIActivityViewController) -> Any {
    // Return a placeholder item that is used until the actual content is available.
    return ""
}

func activityViewController(_ activityViewController: UIActivityViewController, itemForActivityType activityType: UIActivity.ActivityType?) -> Any? {
    // Provide the content to be shared based on the activity type.
    return "Hello, World!"
}

func activityViewController(_ activityViewController: UIActivityViewController, subjectForActivityType activityType: UIActivity.ActivityType?) -> String {
    // Provide the subject (title) for the shared content.
    return "Sharing Example"
}
```

## Step 4: Configuring Share UI in Interface Builder

1. Open the **MainInterface.storyboard** file of your share extension target.
2. Remove the default view controller and add a new **ViewController**.
3. Assign the custom class `ShareViewController` to the newly added view controller.
4. Design the user interface as per your requirement for the share extension.

## Step 5: Building and Testing

1. Build and run your app with the share extension target selected.
2. Install the app on a physical device or simulator.
3. Navigate to another app that supports sharing.
4. Tap on the sharing button and select your app's share extension from the options.
5. Observe that your custom share UI is displayed, and the content is shared when the user selects the share option.

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented share extensions in ViewControllers using Swift. Now, your app can receive and handle shared content from other applications seamlessly.
