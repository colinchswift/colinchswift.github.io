In any iOS application, user-input is a crucial aspect of the user interface. Text fields and text views are commonly used to obtain user input in forms, notes, or messaging functionalities. In this blog post, we will explore how to handle user input with text fields and text views in ViewControllers using Swift.

## Setting up the User Interface

First, we need to create a user interface with text fields and text views to collect user input. Open your Xcode project and navigate to the storyboard file. Drag and drop a `UITextField` and a `UITextView` onto your view controller. Set appropriate constraints to position them as desired. Make sure to set appropriate `IBOutlet` connections for both the text field and the text view in your view controller.

## Handling Text Field Input

To handle user input from a text field, we need to conform to the `UITextFieldDelegate` protocol. Open your view controller file and add the following code:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, UITextFieldDelegate {
    @IBOutlet weak var textField: UITextField!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        textField.delegate = self
    }

    func textFieldShouldReturn(_ textField: UITextField) -> Bool {
        textField.resignFirstResponder()
        return true
    }
}
```

In the code above, we set the view controller as the delegate of the `UITextField` and implement the `textFieldShouldReturn` method. The `textFieldShouldReturn` method is called when the user taps the Return or Done button on the keyboard. In this implementation, we simply dismiss the keyboard by calling `resignFirstResponder()` on the text field and returning `true`.

## Handling Text View Input

For text views, we don't have a built-in delegate method like `textFieldShouldReturn` that handles the Return or Done button. However, we can add a UIBarButtonItem to the keyboard's accessory view (or use a custom toolbar) to provide a Done button functionality. Here's an example implementation:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, UITextViewDelegate {
    @IBOutlet weak var textView: UITextView!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        textView.delegate = self
        addDoneButtonToKeyboardAccessoryView()
    }

    func addDoneButtonToKeyboardAccessoryView() {
        let doneButton = UIBarButtonItem(barButtonSystemItem: .done, target: self, action: #selector(doneButtonTapped))
        let accessoryView = UIToolbar(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: view.frame.width, height: 44))
        accessoryView.items = [UIBarButtonItem.flexibleSpace, doneButton]
        textView.inputAccessoryView = accessoryView
    }

    @objc func doneButtonTapped() {
        textView.resignFirstResponder()
    }
}
```

In the code above, we set the view controller as the delegate of the `UITextView` and implement the `addDoneButtonToKeyboardAccessoryView` method to add a Done button to the keyboard's accessory view. The `doneButtonTapped` method is called when the user taps the Done button, and we dismiss the keyboard by calling `resignFirstResponder()` on the text view.

## Conclusion

Handling user input with text fields and text views is an essential part of developing iOS applications. By implementing the appropriate delegate methods, we can effectively manage user input, provide a better user experience, and enable the functionality that relies on that input.

By following the guidelines outlined in this blog post, you are now equipped with the knowledge of handling text fields and text views in ViewControllers using Swift. Start implementing these techniques in your projects to enhance user interactions and improve your app's functionality.
