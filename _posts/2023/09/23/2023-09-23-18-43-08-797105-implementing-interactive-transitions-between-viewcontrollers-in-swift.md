When it comes to creating smooth and interactive user experiences in iOS apps, implementing animated transitions between ViewControllers can greatly enhance the overall user experience. Fortunately, with the help of UIKit framework in Swift, adding cool and interactive transitions is easier than ever. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement interactive transitions between ViewControllers in Swift.

## What are Interactive Transitions?

Interactive transitions allow users to interact with the transition between two ViewControllers by dragging, pinching, or swiping gestures. This gives users a sense of control and adds an element of engagement to the app.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into implementing interactive transitions, let's make sure we have the prerequisites in place:

- Xcode 13 or higher
- Swift knowledge
- Basic understanding of UIKit framework

## Step-by-step Guide

### Step 1: Set up your project

First, create a new Xcode project or open an existing one. Make sure to select the appropriate project template based on your requirements.

### Step 2: Create a custom UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate

To implement interactive transitions, we need to create a custom `UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate` class. This delegate will define how the transition should occur.

Create a new Swift file and name it `CustomTransitionDelegate.swift`. In this file, define the following class:

```swift
import UIKit

class CustomTransitionDelegate: NSObject, UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate {

    // Implement the necessary methods

}
```

### Step 3: Implement the necessary methods

Inside the `CustomTransitionDelegate` class, we need to implement two methods: `animationController(forPresented:presenting:source:)` and `animationController(forDismissed:)`. These methods will be responsible for creating and returning the appropriate animator objects for presenting and dismissing ViewControllers respectively.

```swift
import UIKit

class CustomTransitionDelegate: NSObject, UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate {

    // Method called while presenting a ViewController
    func animationController(forPresented presented: UIViewController, presenting: UIViewController, source: UIViewController) -> UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning? {
        // Return the animator object for presenting
    }

    // Method called while dismissing a ViewController
    func animationController(forDismissed dismissed: UIViewController) -> UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning? {
        // Return the animator object for dismissing
    }

}
```

### Step 4: Create a custom UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning

Now, we need to create a custom `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning` class that will define how the animations should behave during the transition.

Create a new Swift file and name it `CustomTransitionAnimator.swift`. In this file, define the following class:

```swift
import UIKit

class CustomTransitionAnimator: NSObject, UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning {

    // Implement the necessary methods

}
```

### Step 5: Implement the necessary animation methods

Inside the `CustomTransitionAnimator` class, we need to implement two methods: `transitionDuration(using:)` and `animateTransition(using:)`. These methods will define the duration of the transition and how the animations should be performed.

```swift
import UIKit

class CustomTransitionAnimator: NSObject, UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning {

    // Method to define the duration of the transition
    func transitionDuration(using transitionContext: UIViewControllerContextTransitioning?) -> TimeInterval {
        // Return the duration of the transition in seconds
    }

    // Method to perform the animations during the transition
    func animateTransition(using transitionContext: UIViewControllerContextTransitioning) {
        // Perform the animations here
    }

}
```

### Step 6: Wire everything together

Now that we have the delegate and animator classes, we need to wire everything together in the ViewControllers where we want the interactive transitions.

In the presenting ViewController, set the `transitioningDelegate` property of the presenting ViewController to an instance of the `CustomTransitionDelegate` class. 

In the ViewController being presented, make sure to set its `modalPresentationStyle` property to `.custom`.

```swift
let customTransitionDelegate = CustomTransitionDelegate()
presentingViewController.transitioningDelegate = customTransitionDelegate

let viewControllerToPresent = ViewControllerToPresent()
viewControllerToPresent.modalPresentationStyle = .custom
present(presentingViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

### Step 7: Implement gesture recognizer logic

To enable interactive transitions, we need to implement gesture recognizer logic. This can be achieved by adding gesture recognizers to the ViewControllers where we want the interactive transitions.

Let's say we want to enable transitions by swiping from left to right. In the presented ViewController, add the following code to set up the swipe gesture recognizer:

```swift
let swipeGestureRecognizer = UISwipeGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(handleSwipeGesture(_:)))
swipeGestureRecognizer.direction = .right
view.addGestureRecognizer(swipeGestureRecognizer)
```

Implement the `handleSwipeGesture` method to handle the swipe gesture:

```swift
@objc func handleSwipeGesture(_ recognizer: UISwipeGestureRecognizer) {
    // Implement the logic to initiate the interactive transition
}
```

### Step 8: Complete the interactive transition

To complete the interactive transition, we need to update the delegate and animator classes to handle the user interaction during the transition.

- In the `CustomTransitionDelegate` class, implement the `interactionControllerForPresentation(using:)` and `interactionControllerForDismissal(using:)` methods to return an instance of a custom interactive transition controller.
- In the `CustomTransitionAnimator` class, implement the `interruptibleAnimator(using:)` method to return an instance of a custom interruptible animator.

### Step 9: Test and Refine

Run your app and test the interactive transitions. Adjust the animations and user experience based on your requirements.

## Conclusion

Adding interactive transitions between ViewControllers can greatly enhance the user experience in iOS apps. By following the step-by-step guide outlined in this blog post, you can implement interactive transitions in Swift with ease. Start experimenting and take your app's user experience to the next level!
