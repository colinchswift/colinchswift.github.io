Are you interested in leveraging the power of Core Video to process videos within your Swift-based iOS app? In this article, we will explore how to work with Core Video framework in ViewControllers to perform video processing tasks.

## What is Core Video?
Core Video is a framework provided by Apple that allows developers to work with video and image buffers at a low level. It provides tools for creating, manipulating, and rendering video frames.

## Setting Up the Project
Before we dive into coding, let's start by setting up our project. Create a new project in Xcode and select the SwiftUI App template. Give your project a name and select the desired options.

## Importing the Core Video Framework
To start working with Core Video in a ViewController, we need to import the CoreVideo framework. In your ViewController file, add the following import statement at the beginning:

```swift
import CoreVideo
```

## Capturing a Video
To begin video processing, we first need to capture a video using the device camera. The AVFoundation framework provides the necessary classes to accomplish this. Below is an example of how to set up a video capture session in the `viewDidLoad` method of your ViewController:

```swift
import AVFoundation

class MyViewController: UIViewController {

    private var captureSession: AVCaptureSession?
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        // Create capture session
        self.captureSession = AVCaptureSession()
        
        // Set up input device
        let captureDevice = AVCaptureDevice.default(for: .video)
        guard let inputDevice = try? AVCaptureDeviceInput(device: captureDevice!) else { return }
        self.captureSession?.addInput(inputDevice)
        
        // Set up output data buffer
        let videoOutput = AVCaptureVideoDataOutput()
        videoOutput.setSampleBufferDelegate(self, queue: DispatchQueue(label: "VideoOutputQueue"))
        self.captureSession?.addOutput(videoOutput)
        
        // Start video capture
        self.captureSession?.startRunning()
    }
}
```

## Implementing the Video Output Delegate
To process each video frame, we need to implement the `AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate` protocol. This protocol provides a method called `captureOutput(_:didOutput:from:)` that is called for each video frame captured. Below is an example implementation of this delegate method:

```swift
extension MyViewController: AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate {
    
    func captureOutput(_ output: AVCaptureOutput, didOutput sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, from connection: AVCaptureConnection) {
        
        // Process the video sample buffer here
        
        // Convert CMSampleBuffer to CVImageBuffer
        guard let imageBuffer = CMSampleBufferGetImageBuffer(sampleBuffer) else { return }
        
        // Lock the base address of the pixel buffer
        CVPixelBufferLockBaseAddress(imageBuffer, .readOnly)
        
        // Get the pixel buffer's base address and create a pointer to it
        guard let baseAddress = CVPixelBufferGetBaseAddressOfPlane(imageBuffer, 0) else { return }
        let bufferPointer = baseAddress.assumingMemoryBound(to: UInt8.self)
        
        // Perform video processing on the buffer
        
        // Unlock the pixel buffer base address
        CVPixelBufferUnlockBaseAddress(imageBuffer, .readOnly)
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
With Core Video, you can leverage the power of low-level video processing and manipulate video frames in real-time within your ViewControllers. This opens up a wide range of possibilities for video editing, computer vision, and augmented reality applications. Explore the Core Video documentation to discover more capabilities and techniques for working with videos in your Swift projects!

Remember to import the `CoreVideo` framework, set up a video capture session using `AVCaptureSession`, and implement the `AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate` protocol to process video frames. Happy coding!
