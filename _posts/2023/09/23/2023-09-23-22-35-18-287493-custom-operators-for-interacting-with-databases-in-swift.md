When working with databases in Swift, it is common to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations frequently. To streamline this process and make database interactions more readable and expressive, custom operators can be used. In this article, we will explore how to create custom operators for interacting with databases in Swift.

## Setting up the Database

Before diving into custom operators, we first need to set up a database. For this example, we will use SQLite, a popular embedded database that works well with Swift.

To get started, you need to import the SQLite library into your Swift project. This can be done using CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager. Once the library is imported, you can create a database connection and initialize a table.

```swift
import SQLite

// Create a connection to the database
let db = try Connection("path/to/database.sqlite")

// Define a table
let users = Table("users")
let id = Expression<Int>("id")
let name = Expression<String>("name")

// Create the table if it doesn't exist
try db.run(users.create { table in
    table.column(id, primaryKey: true)
    table.column(name)
})
```

## Custom Operators for Database Interactions

Now that we have set up our database, let's create some custom operators to simplify the CRUD operations.

### Insertion Operator

The insertion operator (`<<<`) can be used to insert data into the database.

```swift
infix operator <<<

func <<< <T: Table>(table: T, values: [Setter]) throws -> Int64 {
    return try db.run(table.insert(values))
}

// Usage
let userData: [Setter] = [name <- "John Doe"]
let insertedId = try users <<< userData
```

### Selection Operator

The selection operator (`>>>`) can be used to retrieve data from the database.

```swift
infix operator >>>

func >>> <T: Table>(table: T, condition: Expression<Bool>) throws -> [Row] {
    return try db.prepare(table.filter(condition)).map { row in
        return row
    }
}

// Usage
let selectedUsers = try users >>> (name == "John Doe")
for user in selectedUsers {
    print("Name: \(user[name])")
}
```

### Update Operator

The update operator (`><`) can be used to update data in the database.

```swift
infix operator ><

func >< <T: Table>(table: T, conditions: [Expressible]) throws -> Int {
    let query = table.update(conditions)
    return try db.run(query)
}

// Usage
let updatedRows = try users >< [name <- "Jane Smith"]
```

### Deletion Operator

The deletion operator (`---`) can be used to delete data from the database.

```swift
prefix operator ---

prefix func --- <T: Table>(table: T) throws -> Int {
    let query = table.delete()
    return try db.run(query)
}

// Usage
let deletedRows = try ---users
```

## Conclusion

By creating custom operators for interacting with databases in Swift, we can make our code more expressive and easier to understand. These custom operators simplify the syntax for common database operations and improve the readability of our code.

Using the custom operators described in this article, you can now perform CRUD operations with greater clarity and efficiency in your Swift projects. However, keep in mind that custom operators should be used thoughtfully and sparingly, ensuring they enhance the readability and maintainability of the codebase.
