In this tutorial, we will explore how to add audio playback functionality in ViewControllers using Swift. 

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Swift programming language and Xcode IDE.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Project

Launch Xcode and create a new project. Choose the Single View App template and provide a suitable name for your project.

## Step 2: Import AVFoundation Framework

To work with audio playback, we need to import the `AVFoundation` framework. Open your ViewController.swift file and add the following import statement at the top of the file:

```swift
import AVFoundation
```

## Step 3: Declare Variables and Outlets

Declare the necessary variables and outlets in your ViewController class. 

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {

    var audioPlayer: AVAudioPlayer?
    @IBOutlet weak var playButton: UIButton!
    @IBOutlet weak var stopButton: UIButton!
    
    // Rest of the code...
}
```

## Step 4: Setting Up the Audio Player

Inside the ViewController's viewDidLoad() method, add the code to set up the audio player:

```swift
audioPlayer = AVAudioPlayer()
guard let audioFilePath = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "audio_file_name", ofType: "mp3") else { 
    return 
}

let audioFileURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: audioFilePath)

do {
    audioPlayer = try AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: audioFileURL)
} catch {
    // Handle any errors
}
```

Make sure to replace "audio_file_name" with the actual name of your audio file.

## Step 5: Playing and Stopping Audio

Add the following actions to play and stop the audio:

```swift
@IBAction func playButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
    audioPlayer?.play()
}

@IBAction func stopButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
    audioPlayer?.stop()
    audioPlayer?.currentTime = 0
}
```

## Step 6: Interface Builder Setup

Open your storyboard file and connect the play and stop buttons to their respective outlets and actions in the ViewController class.

## Step 7: Testing

Build and run your project on a simulator or device. You should now be able to play and stop the audio by tapping on the respective buttons.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can easily add audio playback functionality to your ViewControllers in Swift. You can further enhance the user experience by adding additional features like volume control or seeking through the audio file.
