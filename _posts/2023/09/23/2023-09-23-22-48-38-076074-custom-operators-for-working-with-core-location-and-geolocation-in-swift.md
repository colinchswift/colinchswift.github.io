Core Location is a powerful framework in Swift that allows developers to access various location and heading data on iOS devices. Geolocation is a fundamental aspect of many apps, and it's crucial to handle it efficiently and effectively. In this blog post, we will explore how to create custom operators in Swift to streamline the process of working with Core Location and geolocation.

## Why Use Custom Operators?

Using custom operators can make your code more readable and expressive. They allow you to define your own symbols and combine them with existing operators to create new functionality. By using custom operators, you can enhance your code's clarity and maintainability.

## Implementing Custom Operators for Core Location and Geolocation

Let's start by defining two custom operators: `~~>` and `<~~`. These operators will help us handle geolocation-related tasks more conveniently.

### The `~~>` Operator

The `~~>` operator enables us to convert a `CLLocation` object to a tuple of latitude and longitude values. To implement this operator, add the following code to your project:

```swift
infix operator ~~>

func ~~>(location: CLLocation) -> (lat: Double, lon: Double) {
    return (location.coordinate.latitude, location.coordinate.longitude)
}
```

This operator converts a `CLLocation` object to a tuple containing latitude (`lat`) and longitude (`lon`) values. You can use it like this:

```swift
let location = CLLocation(latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194)
let coordinates = location ~~> // (lat: 37.7749, lon: -122.4194)
```

### The `<~~` Operator

The `<~~` operator allows us to create a `CLLocation` object from a tuple of latitude and longitude values. Here's how you can implement it:

```swift
infix operator <~~

func <~~(coordinates: (lat: Double, lon: Double)) -> CLLocation {
    return CLLocation(latitude: coordinates.lat, longitude: coordinates.lon)
}
```

With this operator, you can create `CLLocation` objects from latitude and longitude values like this:

```swift
let coordinates = (lat: 37.7749, lon: -122.4194)
let location = coordinates <~~ // CLLocation(latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194)
```

## Conclusion

Custom operators can greatly simplify working with Core Location and geolocation in Swift. By defining operators like `~~>` and `<~~`, you can enhance readability and make your code more concise. Remember to use these operators responsibly and considerately in your projects.
