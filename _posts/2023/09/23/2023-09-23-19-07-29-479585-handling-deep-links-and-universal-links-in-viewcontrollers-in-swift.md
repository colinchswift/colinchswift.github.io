Deep links and universal links are powerful mechanisms for launching specific parts of your app from external sources, such as a website or another app. In this blog post, we will explore how to handle deep links and universal links in ViewControllers using Swift.

## What are Deep Links and Universal Links?
Deep links are URLs that directly point to a specific content or feature within an app. When a user taps on a deep link, it opens the app and navigates to the corresponding screen or view.

Universal links are a more advanced form of deep links introduced in iOS 9. Unlike deep links, universal links seamlessly open the associated content in the app, without prompting the user or redirecting to Safari. They provide a consistent user experience and can be used to handle deep linking for both iOS and Android platforms.

## Handling Deep Links in ViewControllers
To handle deep links within a ViewController, you need to implement the `UIApplicationDelegate` protocol's `application(_:open:options:)` method. Here's an example of how you can handle deep links in a ViewController:

```swift
// AppDelegate.swift

import UIKit

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    // ...

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
        
        if let deepLink = DeepLinkManager.parseDeepLink(url: url) {
            if let viewController = deepLink.viewController {
                // Navigate to the specific ViewController for the deep link
                let rootViewController = self.window?.rootViewController as? UINavigationController
                rootViewController?.pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }

    // ...
}
```
This code snippet demonstrates a basic implementation of handling deep links in the AppDelegate. The `DeepLinkManager` class is responsible for parsing the deep link URL and returning a corresponding ViewController.

## Handling Universal Links in ViewControllers
Handling universal links is similar to handling deep links. However, instead of using the `application(_:open:options:)` method, you need to implement the `UIApplicationDelegate` protocol's `application(_:continue:restorationHandler:)` method.

Here's an example of how you can handle universal links in a ViewController:

```swift
// AppDelegate.swift

import UIKit

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    // ...

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity, restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) -> Void) -> Bool {
        
        if userActivity.activityType == NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb {
            if let url = userActivity.webpageURL {
                if let deepLink = DeepLinkManager.parseDeepLink(url: url) {
                    if let viewController = deepLink.viewController {
                        // Navigate to the specific ViewController for the deep link
                        let rootViewController = self.window?.rootViewController as? UINavigationController
                        rootViewController?.pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }

    // ...
}
```
This code snippet shows how to handle universal links inside the AppDelegate. The `DeepLinkManager` class is responsible for parsing the universal link URL and returning the appropriate ViewController.

## Conclusion
Handling deep links and universal links in ViewControllers allows you to provide a seamless and interactive user experience by deep linking into specific parts of your app. By implementing the necessary methods in the AppDelegate and using a deep link manager, you can easily navigate to the relevant ViewController based on the link's target. Taking advantage of deep linking can greatly enhance the integration between different platforms and improve user engagement with your app.
