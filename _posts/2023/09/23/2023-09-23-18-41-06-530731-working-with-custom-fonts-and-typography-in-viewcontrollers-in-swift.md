## Introduction

Typography plays a crucial role in the overall design and user experience of an application. By using custom fonts, we can enhance the visual appeal and uniqueness of our app. In this tutorial, we will explore how to work with custom fonts and implement typography in ViewControllers using Swift.

## Step 1: Adding Custom Fonts to your Project

1. Locate the custom font file (usually in .ttf or .otf format) that you want to use in your application.
2. Drag and drop the font file into your Xcode project. Ensure that "Copy items if needed" is selected and your target is checked.
3. In your project settings, go to the target's "Build Phases" tab and under "Copy Bundle Resources", confirm that the font file is listed. If not, manually add it.

## Step 2: Registering Custom Fonts

1. Open your project's `Info.plist` file.
2. Add a new row with the key "Fonts provided by application".
3. For each custom font file you want to use, add an item to the array and specify the filename. e.g., "CustomFont.ttf".

## Step 3: Utilizing Custom Fonts in ViewControllers

1. Import `UIKit` in your ViewController.
2. Identify the desired text elements (e.g., labels, buttons, etc.) that you want to apply the custom font to.
3. Set the font property of the text element to the custom font.

Here's an example code snippet showing how to use a custom font in a ViewController:

```swift
import UIKit

class MyViewController: UIViewController {
    @IBOutlet weak var titleLabel: UILabel!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        titleLabel.font = UIFont(name: "CustomFont", size: 24)
    }
}
```

In the above code, we import `UIKit` and create a subclass of `UIViewController`. We have an `UILabel` outlet named `titleLabel` that represents our title label in the ViewController's storyboard. In the `viewDidLoad` method, we set the font of the `titleLabel` to a custom font named "CustomFont" with a size of 24.

## Conclusion

Custom fonts and typography can greatly enhance the visual appeal and branding of your application. In this tutorial, we learned how to add custom fonts to our Xcode project, register them in the `Info.plist` file, and utilize them in ViewControllers in Swift. By following these steps, you can easily implement custom fonts and typography in your own projects. #Swift #CustomFonts
