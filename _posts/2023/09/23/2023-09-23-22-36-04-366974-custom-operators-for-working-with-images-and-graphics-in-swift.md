Working with images and graphics often involves performing operations such as resizing, cropping, and blending. While Swift provides a rich set of built-in operators and methods for manipulating data, you may find it beneficial to define custom operators for specific image and graphics-related operations. In this blog post, we will explore how to define custom operators in Swift for working with images and graphics.

## Operator Overloading in Swift

Swift allows you to overload existing operators or define new operators for your custom types. This powerful feature enables you to create expressive and readable code when working with images and graphics. Custom operators can encapsulate specific operations and make your code more concise and intuitive.

## Declaring Custom Operators

To define a custom operator, you need to choose a valid operator symbol. Swift supports a range of symbols for custom operators, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `=`, `>`, `!`, and more. You can also use Unicode characters as custom operator symbols.

Custom operators in Swift need to be declared using the `operator` keyword followed by the operator symbol and any additional attributes. Let's define two custom operators for manipulating images and graphics:

```swift
// Custom operator for resizing an image
infix operator <| : AdditionPrecedence

// Custom operator for blending two images
infix operator >< : AdditionPrecedence
```

In the above code, we have defined `<|` as the operator symbol for resizing an image, and `><` for blending two images. We have used the `infix` keyword to specify that these operators are binary infix operators, operating between two operands.

## Implementing Custom Operators

Once we have defined the custom operators, we need to implement the logic for performing the desired operations. Let's see how we can implement the custom operators for resizing and blending images using Swift's Core Graphics framework:

```swift
import CoreGraphics

// Custom operator for resizing an image
func <| (lhs: CGImage, rhs: CGSize) -> CGImage? {
    let context = CGContext(data: nil, width: Int(rhs.width), height: Int(rhs.height), bitsPerComponent: 8, bytesPerRow: 0, space: CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB(), bitmapInfo: CGImageAlphaInfo.premultipliedLast.rawValue)
    
    context?.draw(lhs, in: CGRect(origin: .zero, size: rhs))
    
    return context?.makeImage()
}

// Custom operator for blending two images
func >< (lhs: CGImage, rhs: CGImage) -> CGImage? {
    let rect = CGRect(origin: .zero, size: CGSize(width: min(lhs.width, rhs.width), height: min(lhs.height, rhs.height)))
    
    let context = CGContext(data: nil, width: Int(rect.width), height: Int(rect.height), bitsPerComponent: 8, bytesPerRow: 0, space: CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB(), bitmapInfo: CGImageAlphaInfo.premultipliedLast.rawValue)
    
    context?.draw(lhs, in: rect)
    context?.draw(rhs, in: rect, blendMode: .normal)
    
    return context?.makeImage()
}
```

In the above code, we define the custom operators `|<` and `><` for resizing and blending images, respectively. These operators take the left-hand side operand as the input image(s) and the right-hand side operand as the parameters required for the operation. The custom operators return the resulting image as a `CGImage`.

## Usage of Custom Operators

Once we have defined and implemented the custom operators, we can use them in our code for image and graphics manipulations. Let's see a few examples:

```swift
import UIKit

let image = UIImage(named: "example-image.jpg")?.cgImage

// Resizing an image
let resizedImage = image <| CGSize(width: 200, height: 200)

// Blending two images
let blendedImage = image >< resizedImage

```

In the above code, we first load an image from a file or any other source and convert it to a `CGImage`. We then use the custom operators `<|` and `><` to resize the image and blend it with another image, respectively.

## Conclusion

Defining custom operators in Swift can greatly improve the readability and expressiveness of your code when working with images and graphics. By encapsulating specific operations in custom operators, you can create a more intuitive and concise codebase. Remember to use custom operators judiciously and document their purpose and behavior for better code clarity.
