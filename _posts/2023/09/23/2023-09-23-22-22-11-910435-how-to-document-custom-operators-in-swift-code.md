When working with custom operators in Swift code, it is essential to provide clear and comprehensive documentation to ensure the code's readability and maintainability. By documenting your custom operators, other developers, including your future self, can easily understand their purpose and usage. In this article, we will discuss how to effectively document custom operators in Swift code.

## 1. Use Documentation Comments

One of the best practices for documenting Swift code, including custom operators, is to use documentation comments. Documentation comments begin with `///` and allow you to add descriptive text that explains the functionality, usage, and any important considerations for the custom operator.

For example, let's say you have created a custom operator called `***` that performs a specific mathematical operation. Here's how you can document it using documentation comments:

```swift
/// Performs a custom mathematical operation using the `left` and `right` operands.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - left: The left operand.
///   - right: The right operand.
/// - Returns: The result of the mathematical operation.
infix operator ***

/// Performs a custom mathematical operation.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - left: The left operand.
///   - right: The right operand.
/// - Returns: The result of the mathematical operation.
public func ***<T: Numeric>(left: T, right: T) -> T {
    // Implementation of the custom operator
}
```

By using documentation comments, you provide clear information about the operator's purpose, the parameters it accepts, and the value it returns.

## 2. Describe Operator Behavior

When documenting custom operators, it's important to describe their behavior and specific use cases. This helps other developers understand the intended functionality and prevents misuse or misunderstandings.

For example, consider a custom operator `>>`, which performs a specific transformation on a given value. You can document it as follows:

```swift
/// Performs a transformation on the given value, returning the transformed value.
///
/// - Important: This operator must be used with caution and only in specific cases.
///
/// - Parameter value: The value to be transformed.
/// - Returns: The transformed value.
postfix operator >>
public postfix func >><T>(value: T) -> T {
    // Implementation of the custom operator
}
```

By mentioning any important considerations or restrictions on using the custom operator, you ensure that developers who encounter it in the future are aware of its behavior.

## Conclusion

Documenting custom operators in your Swift code is crucial for code maintainability and readability. By using documentation comments and describing the operator's purpose and behavior, you provide valuable information to other developers. Take the time to document your custom operators, and ensure that your code remains comprehensible and accessible to everyone who works with it.
