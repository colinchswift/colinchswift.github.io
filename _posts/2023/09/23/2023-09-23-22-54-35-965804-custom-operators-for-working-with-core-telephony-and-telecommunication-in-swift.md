With the advancement of telecommunication technology, working with telephony APIs has become an essential part of modern app development. In Swift, the Core Telephony framework provides a powerful set of tools for interacting with telephony services on iOS devices. To simplify and enhance the readability of your code, you can define custom operators to encapsulate common telephony operations. In this article, we will explore how to create custom operators for working with Core Telephony in Swift.

## Operator Overloading in Swift

Swift allows you to overload existing operators or define custom operators to extend the functionality of built-in types or user-defined types. Operator overloading is a powerful feature that lets you use operators such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` with your custom types. This flexibility can be leveraged to create custom operators for telephony tasks.

## Custom Operator for Checking Network Availability

One common task when working with telephony services is to check the availability of a network connection. We can create a custom operator that checks if the device is connected to the internet or not.

```swift
infix operator ??: AdditionPrecedence

func ??(lhs: CTCarrier?, rhs: String) -> String {
    guard let carrier = lhs else {
        return rhs
    }
    
    return carrier.carrierName ?? rhs
}
```

In the example above, we define the infix operator `??` which takes two operands of type `CTCarrier?` (optional CTCarrier) and `String`. The operator checks if the left-hand side operand (`lhs`) is nil. If it is nil, it returns the right-hand side operand (`rhs`) which can be a default string value. If the left-hand side operand is not nil, it returns the `carrierName` property of the `CTCarrier` object if available, otherwise it returns the default string.

Usage:

```swift
let telephonyNetworkInfo = CTTelephonyNetworkInfo()

if let carrier = telephonyNetworkInfo.subscriberCellularProvider {
    let networkName = carrier ?? "No Network"
    print("Currently connected to: \(networkName)")
} else {
    print("No telephony service available")
}
```

In the example above, we check if the `subscriberCellularProvider` property of `CTTelephonyNetworkInfo` is not nil. If it is not nil, we use the custom operator `??` to retrieve the network name or display a default value if the network name is unavailable.

## Custom Operator for Checking Call State

Another common task is to check the current call state on the device. We can create a custom operator that simplifies the process.

```swift
prefix operator -->

prefix func -->(state: CTCallState) -> String {
    switch state {
    case .connected:
        return "Call Connected"
    case .dialing:
        return "Call Dialing"
    case .disconnected:
        return "Call Disconnected"
    case .incoming:
        return "Call Incoming"
    case .connectedTransferred:
        return "Call Connected, Transferred"
    default:
        return "Unknown Call State"
    }
}
```

In the example above, we define the prefix operator `-->` which takes an operand of type `CTCallState` and returns a string representing the call state. The operator performs a switch statement on the call state and returns the corresponding string representation.

Usage:

```swift
let telephonyCenter = CTTelephonyCenterGetDefault()
let callback: CTCallCenterCallEventHandler = { call in
    let callState = -->(call.callState)
    print(callState)
}

let callCenter = CTCallCenter()
callCenter.callEventHandler = callback
```

In the example above, we define a callback function to handle call events with the `CTCallCenter` class. When a call event is received, we use the custom operator `-->` to convert the call state to a human-readable string and print it.

## Conclusion

By creating custom operators, we can simplify and enhance the readability of telephony-related code in Swift. The examples in this article demonstrate how to create custom operators for checking network availability and call state. These custom operators can be used to write more concise and expressive code when working with the Core Telephony framework. Harness the power of operator overloading and boost your productivity when integrating telephony functionalities into your Swift applications.
