As the world becomes increasingly digital, the need for secure and trustworthy document handling has become crucial. Swift, Apple's programming language, provides powerful tools for implementing document signing and encryption to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information. In this blog post, we will explore how to add document signing and encryption functionalities to your Swift document-based apps.

## Document Signing

Document signing is a process that allows you to digitally sign a document to verify its authenticity and integrity. By signing a document, you can ensure that it has not been tampered with since it was signed and that it originated from a trusted source.

To implement document signing in your Swift app, you can leverage the [CryptoKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cryptokit) framework, introduced in iOS 13 and macOS 10.15. Here's an example of how to sign a document using CryptoKit:

```swift
import CryptoKit

func signDocument(document: Document) -> Data {
    let privateKey = // Load private key from storage
    
    guard let privateKey = CryptoUtils.importPrivateKey(privateKey) else {
        fatalError("Failed to import private key")
    }
    
    let signature = try! privateKey.signature(for: document.data)
    
    return signature
}
```

In this example, we load the private key of the signer and use it to create a digital signature for the document data. You can then attach the signature to the document or store it separately for verification at a later stage.

## Document Encryption

Document encryption is vital for protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access. Encryption ensures that data can only be read by authorized individuals who possess the decryption key.

To implement document encryption in your Swift app, you can use the [CommonCrypto](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/commoncrypto) library, which is part of the Security framework. Here's an example of how to encrypt a document using CommonCrypto:

```swift
import CommonCrypto

func encryptDocument(document: Document) throws -> Data {
    let key = // Generate encryption key
    
    // Create encryption context
    var cryptor: CCCryptorRef?
    
    let status = CCCryptorCreateWithMode(
        CCOperation(kCCEncrypt),
        CCMode(kCCModeCBC),
        CCAlgorithm(kCCAlgorithmAES),
        CCPadding(kCCPaddingPKCS7),
        key.bytes,
        key.count,
        nil,
        0,
        0,
        0,
        CCModeOptions(kCCModeOptionCTR_BE),
        &cryptor
    )
    
    guard status == kCCSuccess else {
        throw EncryptionError.encryptionFailed
    }
    
    // Perform encryption
    let encryptedData = try document.data.withUnsafeBytes { (inputPtr: UnsafeRawBufferPointer) throws -> Data in
        guard let inputBytes = inputPtr.baseAddress?.assumingMemoryBound(to: UInt8.self) else {
            throw EncryptionError.invalidData
        }
        
        let inputSize = document.data.count
        let encryptedBuffer = UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt8>.allocate(capacity: inputSize)
        
        var encryptedSize = 0
        let updateStatus = CCCryptorUpdate(
            cryptor!,
            inputBytes,
            inputSize,
            encryptedBuffer,
            inputSize,
            &encryptedSize
        )
        
        guard updateStatus == kCCSuccess else {
            throw EncryptionError.encryptionFailed
        }
        
        let finalStatus = CCCryptorFinal(
            cryptor!,
            encryptedBuffer.advanced(by: encryptedSize),
            inputSize - encryptedSize,
            &encryptedSize
        )
        
        guard finalStatus == kCCSuccess else {
            throw EncryptionError.encryptionFailed
        }
        
        return Data(bytes: encryptedBuffer, count: encryptedSize)
    }
    
    // Clean up
    CCCryptorRelease(cryptor!)
    
    return encryptedData
}
```

In this example, we generate an encryption key and create an encryption context using the AES encryption algorithm in CBC mode with PKCS7 padding. We then perform the encryption using the document data, returning the encrypted data once the encryption process is complete.

By combining document signing and encryption, you can ensure the integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of your documents in Swift document-based apps. Leveraging the power of CryptoKit and CommonCrypto, you can provide robust security features to protect sensitive information in your applications.
