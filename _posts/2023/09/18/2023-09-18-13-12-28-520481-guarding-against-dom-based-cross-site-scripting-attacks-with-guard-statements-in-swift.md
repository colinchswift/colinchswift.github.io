Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a common security vulnerability found in web applications. They occur when an attacker injects malicious scripts into a website, which are then executed by the victim's browser. DOM-based XSS attacks specifically target the Document Object Model (DOM) of a webpage.

To mitigate the risk of DOM-based XSS attacks, it is crucial to properly sanitize user input and ensure that any data displayed in the DOM is properly encoded. In Swift, one way to achieve this is by using guard statements to validate and sanitize input before it is rendered in the DOM.

## Understanding Guard Statements in Swift

Guard statements in Swift provide a concise and expressive way to validate conditions. They help with early exit from a function, closure, or code block when certain conditions are not met. Guard statements are particularly useful for input validation and error handling.

Here's the general syntax of a guard statement in Swift:

```swift
guard condition else {
    // Perform actions when the condition is not met
    // such as returning an error or logging a message
    // then exit the function or block
}
```

## Guarding Against DOM-based XSS Attacks

To guard against DOM-based XSS attacks, we need to ensure that any user-controlled input is properly sanitized before it is rendered in the DOM. Here's an example of how you can use guard statements to sanitize user input in Swift:

```swift
func sanitizeInput(_ input: String) -> String {
    guard let sanitizedInput = input
        .replacingOccurrences(of: "<", with: "&lt;")
        .replacingOccurrences(of: ">", with: "&gt;")
        .replacingOccurrences(of: "\"", with: "&quot;")
        .replacingOccurrences(of: "'", with: "&#39;")
    else {
        return ""
    }
    
    return sanitizedInput
}
```

In this example, the `sanitizeInput` function takes a user input `String` and replaces any potentially dangerous HTML characters with their respective HTML entities. This ensures that the input will be safely rendered in the DOM without executing any malicious scripts.

Now, whenever you need to display user input in the DOM, you can call the `sanitizeInput` function to sanitize the input beforehand:

```swift
let userInput = "<script>alert('XSS attack!');</script>"
let sanitizedInput = sanitizeInput(userInput)

// Output: &lt;script&gt;alert(&#39;XSS attack!&#39;);&lt;/script&gt;
print(sanitizedInput)
```

## Conclusion

Guard statements in Swift provide a powerful tool for guarding against DOM-based XSS attacks by validating and sanitizing user input before rendering it in the DOM. By incorporating proper input validation and sanitization techniques, you can significantly reduce the risk of XSS vulnerabilities in your web applications.

Remember to always follow secure coding practices and stay up-to-date with the latest security guidelines to protect your applications from potential threats.
