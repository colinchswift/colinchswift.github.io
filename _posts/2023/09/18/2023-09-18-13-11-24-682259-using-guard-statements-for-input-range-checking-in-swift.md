Input validation is an essential part of any application to ensure data integrity and prevent unexpected behaviors. In Swift, you can efficiently perform input range checking using guard statements.

## What are Guard Statements?

Guard statements in Swift provide a way to check conditions and exit early if the conditions are not met. They help reduce nested code blocks and make code more readable and maintainable.

## Input Range Checking with Guard Statements

Let's say we have a function that takes an integer input and we want to make sure the input is within a specific range. We can use a guard statement to check this condition. Here's an example:

```swift
func checkInputRange(input: Int) {
    guard input >= 0 && input <= 100 else {
        print("Input out of range")
        return
    }
    
    // Process input within range
    print("Input is within range")
    // Perform additional logic here
}
```

In the above code snippet, we use a guard statement to check if the `input` is between 0 and 100 (inclusive). If the condition fails, the code within the `else` block is executed, printing "Input out of range," and the function returns immediately.

If the input is within the valid range, the execution flow continues to the next line after the guard statement. In this case, it prints "Input is within range." You can perform additional logic or functionality within the scope.

## Benefits of Using Guard Statements

Guard statements offer several benefits when it comes to input range checking:

1. **Early exit:** Guard statements provide an early exit mechanism, allowing you to handle invalid input conditions and return or exit the function early. This helps improve code readability and reduces the need for nested `if` statements.

2. **Clear intent:** By using guard statements, you explicitly state the input range condition that should be met. This makes the code more self-explanatory and easier to understand for other developers.

3. **Code organization:** With guard statements, you can separate input range checks from the main code logic. This enhances code reusability, maintainability, and makes it easier to identify and modify specific validation conditions.

## Conclusion

Using guard statements for input range checking in Swift can improve the robustness and reliability of your code. By checking input conditions early, you can gracefully handle invalid inputs and ensure your code operates within the expected range.

Remember to always validate your inputs to maintain data integrity and prevent unexpected behaviors in your applications.
