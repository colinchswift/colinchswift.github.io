## Introduction
In Swift, error handling plays a crucial role in ensuring the robustness of our code. While Swift provides built-in error types like `NSError` and `Error`, there are situations where we might need to define custom error types to handle specific scenarios. Additionally, guard statements offer an elegant way to handle error conditions in our code. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement custom error types and effectively use guard statements in Swift.

## Custom Error Types
Swift allows us to define custom error types by conforming to the `Error` protocol. By doing so, we can create our own error types that can be thrown and caught within our codebase.

```swift
enum NetworkError: Error {
    case noInternetConnection
    case serverError(statusCode: Int)
    case parsingError(reason: String)
}
```

In the above example, we define a custom `NetworkError` enum that conforms to the `Error` protocol. This enum has three cases representing different error scenarios that we might encounter when working with network operations.

Now, we can throw and catch instances of our custom error type in our code:

```swift
func fetchData() throws {
    // Network request
    guard let response = getResponse() else {
        throw NetworkError.noInternetConnection
    }

    // Process response
}
```

Here, we use a guard statement to check for internet connectivity and throw a `NetworkError.noInternetConnection` if there is no internet connection available.

## Guard Statements
Swift's guard statement provides a concise way to check for error conditions and handle them gracefully. It allows us to exit the current scope (function, loop, or conditional block) early if a condition is not met.

```swift
func divide(_ numerator: Int, by denominator: Int) throws -> Int {
    guard denominator != 0 else {
        throw CalculationError.divideByZero
    }

    return numerator / denominator
}
```

In the above example, we use a guard statement to check if the denominator is zero before performing the division. If the condition fails, it throws a `CalculationError.divideByZero` error and exits the function.

Guard statements can also be used in conjunction with optional unwrapping to handle nullable values:

```swift
func processResponse(_ response: Response?) {
    guard let response = response, response.isValid else {
        return
    }

    // Process the valid response
}
```

In this case, the guard statement checks if the `response` object is not nil and if it is valid. If either condition fails, the function returns early without executing the subsequent code.

## Conclusion
Custom error types and guard statements are powerful tools in Swift that enhance the error handling capabilities of our code. By defining custom error types, we can handle specific error scenarios effectively. Guard statements, on the other hand, provide a concise way to check for error conditions and exit early. By leveraging these features, we can write more robust and readable code in Swift.
