Migrating documents from one app to another can be a complex task, especially when dealing with different file formats and structure. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement document import and migration functionality in a Swift app. We will cover the steps involved and provide example code to help you get started.

## Step 1: Identify Supported File Formats

Before implementing the import and migration functionality, you need to identify the supported file formats that your app can handle. Determine the file types that are compatible with your app's data model and decide which formats you want to support for migration. This step is crucial, as it helps you define the scope of your implementation.

## Step 2: Handle Document Import

To enable document import, you need to handle files shared with your app using the **UIDocumentPickerViewController**. This view controller allows users to select and import documents from various sources, including other apps. Implement the following steps to handle document import:

1. Create an instance of **UIDocumentPickerViewController**.
2. Set the delegate to handle document import callbacks.
3. Present the document picker view controller using the app's root view controller or an appropriate view.
4. Implement the delegate method **documentPicker(_:didPickDocumentsAt:)** to handle the selected documents.

Here's an example code snippet demonstrating the implementation:

```swift
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController, UIDocumentPickerDelegate {
    
    func importDocument() {
        let documentPicker = UIDocumentPickerViewController(documentTypes: ["public.text", "public.image"], in: .import)
        documentPicker.delegate = self
        present(documentPicker, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
    
    func documentPicker(_ controller: UIDocumentPickerViewController, didPickDocumentsAt urls: [URL]) {
        // Handle the imported documents
    }
    
    // Rest of the view controller implementation...
}
```

## Step 3: Perform Document Migration

Once you have the imported documents, you need to implement the document migration logic based on their file format and structure. This step can vary depending on your app's requirements and data model. You may need to parse the documents, convert data formats, and map the data to your app's model objects.

Here's a simplified example demonstrating how to migrate a text document:

```swift
func migrateDocument(_ url: URL) {
    do {
        let documentText = try String(contentsOf: url)
        // Parse and process the document text
        // Migrate to your app's data model
    } catch {
        // Handle error while reading the document
    }
}
```

Remember to adapt this code to handle different file formats and perform the necessary data transformations during migration.

## Step 4: Error Handling and Feedback

Make sure to handle errors during document import and migration gracefully. Display meaningful error messages to the user and provide appropriate feedback if the import or migration process fails. This enhances the user experience and helps them understand any issues encountered.

## Conclusion

Implementing document import and migration functionality in Swift can be challenging but rewarding. By following the steps outlined in this blog post and using the provided example code, you can get started with importing and migrating documents from other apps in your Swift-based project. Remember to adapt the code to fit your specific requirements and file formats.
