Guard statements in Swift provide a way to handle conditions that, if not met, will exit the current scope. This is useful for early returns or validations in your code. While a single guard statement can handle one condition, what if you have multiple conditions that need to be checked? In this blog post, we will explore how to handle multiple conditions with guard statements in Swift.

## The Basics of Guard Statements

Before diving into handling multiple conditions, let's quickly review the basics of guard statements. The general syntax of a guard statement in Swift is as follows:

```swift
guard condition else {
    // Code to execute if condition fails
    // return, throw, or continue
}
```

The `condition` is the expression that needs to evaluate to `true` for the code to continue executing. If the condition is false, the code block inside the `else` block will be executed. It's common to use `return`, `throw`, or `continue` statements within the `else` block.

## Handling Multiple Conditions

When dealing with multiple conditions, you can chain multiple guard statements together. Each guard statement will check its own condition and exit the scope if the condition fails. Here's an example:

```swift
func processInput(_ input: String) {
    guard !input.isEmpty else {
        fatalError("Input cannot be empty")
    }
    
    guard input.count >= 8 else {
        fatalError("Input length must be at least 8 characters")
    }
    
    // Process the input
}
```

In this example, we have a function `processInput` that takes a string parameter `input`. We want to validate the input by checking if it's empty and if its length is at least 8 characters. If either of these conditions fail, we use `fatalError()` to exit the scope with an appropriate error message.

By using multiple guard statements, we can handle each condition separately and provide specific error messages for each case. This helps improve code readability and maintainability.

## Conclusion

Guard statements in Swift provide a clean and concise way to handle conditions, especially for early returns or validations. When dealing with multiple conditions, chaining multiple guard statements is a powerful technique that allows you to handle each condition individually. With this approach, your code becomes more expressive, making it easier to understand and maintain.

Remember to use guard statements judiciously, as using too many can lead to a nested code structure that may be harder to understand. Use guard statements where they provide the most benefit and make your code more readable.
