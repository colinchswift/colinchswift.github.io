In today's rapidly evolving digital world, the ability to import and export documents in various file formats is crucial. Whether you're building a productivity app, a document management system, or a collaboration platform, being able to support different file formats is essential for seamless data interchange.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement document import and export functionality in different file formats using Swift.

## Importing Documents

When it comes to importing documents, we need to provide users with the ability to choose a file from their device and then process and display its content within our app. To achieve this, we can leverage the `UIDocumentPickerViewController` provided by Apple's UIKit framework.

```swift
import UIKit

class MyViewController: UIViewController, UIDocumentPickerDelegate {
    func importDocument() {
        let documentPicker = UIDocumentPickerViewController(documentTypes: ["public.item"], in: .import)
        documentPicker.delegate = self
        present(documentPicker, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }

    func documentPicker(_ controller: UIDocumentPickerViewController, didPickDocumentsAt urls: [URL]) {
        // Process and handle the selected document here
    }
}
```

In the `importDocument` function, we present the `UIDocumentPickerViewController` with the document types set to `public.item`. This will allow the user to select any type of file. You can specify more specific document types based on your app's requirements.

Once the user selects a document, the `didPickDocumentsAt` delegate method is called. Here, you can process and handle the selected document URL according to your app's needs.

## Exporting Documents

Exporting documents involves taking the content generated within your app and saving it to a specific file format that can be shared or opened by other apps. Swift provides various ways to perform document export, but for the sake of simplicity, we'll focus on exporting data to a CSV file format.

```swift
import UIKit

class MyViewController: UIViewController {
    func exportToCSV() {
        let csvText = "Name,Email\nJohn Doe,john@example.com\nJane Smith,jane@example.com"
        
        guard let directoryURL = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask).first else {
            return
        }
        
        let fileURL = directoryURL.appendingPathComponent("data.csv")
        
        do {
            try csvText.write(to: fileURL, atomically: true, encoding: .utf8)
            
            let activityController = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: [fileURL], applicationActivities: nil)
            present(activityController, animated: true)
        } catch {
            print("Failed to export data to CSV: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    }
}
```

In the `exportToCSV` function, we define a CSV string containing the data we want to export. We then obtain the document directory URL using `FileManager.default.urls` and append the desired file name with the `.csv` extension.

After successfully writing the CSV data to the file, we present an `UIActivityViewController` with the file URL as the activity item. This allows the user to share or open the exported file using other apps installed on their device.

## Conclusion

Implementing document import/export functionality in different file formats is an essential aspect of modern app development. In this blog post, we explored how to import documents using `UIDocumentPickerViewController` and export content to a CSV file format in Swift.

By incorporating these features into your app, you can empower users to seamlessly interchange data and improve the overall user experience.
