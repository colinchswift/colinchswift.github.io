### Understanding the Problem

The problem arises when multiple threads access and modify the same global variable simultaneously. This can lead to unexpected behavior and data corruption. To address this issue, we need to synchronize the access to the global variable, allowing only one thread to modify it at a time.

### Solution: Synchronization with Dispatch Queues


One way to achieve thread safety is by using `DispatchQueue` to synchronize the access to the global variable. We can create a serial dispatch queue, which ensures that only one block of code executes at a time. Here's an example:

```swift
let globalQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.example.globalQueue")

var globalVariable = 0

func updateGlobalVariable() {
    globalQueue.sync {
        // Perform any modifications to the global variable here
        globalVariable += 1

        // Access the modified global variable here
        print(globalVariable)
    }
}
```

In the above code, we create a serial dispatch queue named `globalQueue`. The `updateGlobalVariable()` function uses `globalQueue.sync { }` to ensure that only one thread can access and modify the `globalVariable` at a time.

### Benefits of using Synchronization with Dispatch Queues

- **Simplicity**: Implementing synchronization using `DispatchQueue` is relatively straightforward and requires minimal code changes.

- **Performance**: `DispatchQueue` provides efficient and optimized thread synchronization, resulting in better performance compared to other synchronization techniques like locks.

- **Granularity**: By using `DispatchQueue`, you can choose the level of granularity of thread safety. You can create separate dispatch queues for different critical sections of your code, ensuring efficient synchronization.

### Conclusion

In order to achieve thread safety in Swift with global variables, it is essential to synchronize the access and modification of these variables. By utilizing `DispatchQueue` and creating a serial dispatch queue, we can ensure that only one thread modifies the global variable at a time, preventing race conditions and data corruption.

Remember to keep thread safety in mind while developing concurrent applications to ensure data consistency and avoid unpredictable behavior.
