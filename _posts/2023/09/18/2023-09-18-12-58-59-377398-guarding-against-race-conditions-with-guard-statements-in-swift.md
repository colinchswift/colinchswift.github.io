In multi-threaded programming, race conditions can occur when two or more threads access shared resources simultaneously, leading to unpredictable and often incorrect results. Swift provides the `guard` statement as a powerful tool to help you guard against race conditions and ensure thread safety in your code.

## What is a race condition?

A race condition occurs when multiple threads access a shared resource, such as a variable, at the same time. This can lead to unexpected and incorrect behavior as the value of the shared resource is not guaranteed to remain consistent.

Consider the following example:

```swift
var sharedValue = 0

func updateSharedValue() {
    sharedValue += 1
}

DispatchQueue.concurrentPerform(iterations: 100) { _ in
    updateSharedValue()
}

print(sharedValue) // Output: Sometimes prints 100 (correct), sometimes prints less than 100 (incorrect)
```

In this example, we have a `sharedValue` variable that multiple threads increment concurrently using the `updateSharedValue()` function. However, due to the race condition, the final value of `sharedValue` is inconsistent, leading to incorrect results.

## Using guard statements to prevent race conditions

Swift's `guard` statement allows you to specify conditions under which the execution of a block of code should be terminated. By leveraging guard statements, you can exit early from the execution if a race condition is detected.

Here's an example of using a guard statement to prevent race conditions:

```swift
var sharedValue = 0
var sharedValueLock = pthread_rwlock_t()

func updateSharedValue() {
    pthread_rwlock_wrlock(&sharedValueLock)
    sharedValue += 1
    pthread_rwlock_unlock(&sharedValueLock)
}

DispatchQueue.concurrentPerform(iterations: 100) { _ in
    pthread_rwlock_rdlock(&sharedValueLock)
    updateSharedValue()
    pthread_rwlock_unlock(&sharedValueLock)
}

print(sharedValue) // Output: Always prints 100 (correct)
```

In this updated example, we introduced a `sharedValueLock` of type `pthread_rwlock_t` to synchronize access to the `sharedValue` variable. The `pthread_rwlock_wrlock` and `pthread_rwlock_rdlock` functions are used to acquire write and read locks respectively, ensuring that only one thread can modify the `sharedValue` at a time.

By using a guard statement, we can safely assume that the `sharedValueLock` has been locked before accessing the `sharedValue`, preventing race conditions and ensuring thread safety.

## Conclusion

Race conditions can introduce bugs and inconsistencies in multi-threaded programming. Swift's `guard` statement, along with proper synchronization techniques, such as using locks, can help you guard against race conditions and ensure thread safety in your code. By proactively preventing race conditions, you can build more reliable and robust concurrent applications.
