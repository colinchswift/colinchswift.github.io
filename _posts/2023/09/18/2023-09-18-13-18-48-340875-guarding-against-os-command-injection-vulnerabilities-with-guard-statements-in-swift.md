When it comes to developing secure applications, it's essential to safeguard against common vulnerabilities like OS command injection. This type of attack occurs when an attacker is able to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. To mitigate such risks, it's crucial to implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques.

In Swift, one powerful mechanism to defend against command injection vulnerabilities is the use of guard statements. Guard statements provide a concise and readable way to ensure that input parameters and variables meet specified conditions, failing the execution early if those conditions are not met.

Let's take a look at an example to see how guard statements can be used to protect against OS command injection vulnerabilities:

```swift
func executeCommand(_ command: String) {
    guard command.range(of: ";") == nil else {
        print("Invalid command")
        return
    }

    // Code to execute the command securely
    // ...
}
```

In the code above, we define a function `executeCommand` that takes a `command` as input. The guard statement ensures that the `command` does not contain the semicolon character (`;`) which is commonly used to chain multiple commands together in command injection attacks.

If the guard condition fails, meaning the `command` contains a semicolon, we print an error message indicating an invalid command and return early from the function. This prevents any further execution that could potentially lead to a command injection vulnerability.

By utilizing guard statements in this manner, we can effectively prevent the execution of unsafe commands and minimize the risk of OS command injection attacks.

Remember, securing your application goes beyond just input validation, and it's essential to implement other security measures such as proper access controls, input encoding, and output escaping.
