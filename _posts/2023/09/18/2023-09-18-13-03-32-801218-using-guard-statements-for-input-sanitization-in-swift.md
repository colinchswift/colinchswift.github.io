In any application, it's crucial to ensure that user input is secure and free from any malicious code or unexpected values. Input sanitization is a fundamental step in building robust and secure applications.

In Swift, one powerful tool we can use for input sanitization is the `guard` statement. The `guard` statement allows us to check if a condition is met and, if not, exit the current scope early.

Let's take a look at an example of using `guard` statements for input sanitization:

```swift
func processUserInput(username: String?, password: String?) {
    guard let username = username, !username.isEmpty else {
        print("Username is required.")
        return
    }

    guard let password = password, !password.isEmpty else {
        print("Password is required.")
        return
    }

    // Perform further processing with sanitized input
    // ...
}
```

In the above example, we have a function `processUserInput` that takes in optional `username` and `password` parameters. We want to ensure that both of these parameters are provided and not empty before proceeding with any further processing.

Using `guard` statements, we check if `username` and `password` are both non-nil and not empty. If any of these conditions are not met, we print an error message and exit early from the function using `return`.

By using `guard` statements, we can handle input sanitization in a concise and readable manner. It allows us to clearly define the requirements for our inputs and ensures that we catch any invalid or missing values early on.

Additionally, we can extend the example by adding more conditions to check for specific input patterns or formats. For example, we can use regular expressions or custom validation functions to ensure that the password meets certain complexity requirements.

Using guard statements for input sanitization helps improve the security and reliability of our Swift applications. It reduces the chances of encountering unexpected or malicious input and allows us to handle such cases gracefully.
