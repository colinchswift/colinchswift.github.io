In concurrent programming, **thread safety** is a crucial aspect to ensure that shared data is accessed and modified correctly by multiple threads or processes. In Swift, we can achieve thread safety using different techniques, one of which is **transactional memory**.

Transactional memory is a concept that provides a way to perform atomic operations on shared data without explicit locks or synchronization mechanisms. It allows multiple threads to work independently on shared objects by using transactions, ensuring that changes made by one thread are visible to others only after the transaction commits successfully.

To achieve thread safety with transactional memory in Swift, we can leverage the `Transaction` class provided by the **SwiftSTM** library. This library allows us to define code blocks that are executed as atomic transactions, ensuring strong consistency and isolation.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use transactional memory for achieving thread safety in Swift:

```swift
import SwiftSTM

// Define a shared object
class SharedObject {
    var counter: Int = 0
}

// Create a transactional memory
let tm = TransactionalMemory()

// Define a transactional block
func incrementCounter(sharedObject: SharedObject) {
    tm.transaction { transaction in
        sharedObject.counter += 1
    }
}

// Create multiple threads
let thread1 = DispatchQueue(label: "Thread1", attributes: .concurrent)
let thread2 = DispatchQueue(label: "Thread2", attributes: .concurrent)

// Create a shared object
let sharedObject = SharedObject()

// Run transactions concurrently
thread1.async {
    incrementCounter(sharedObject: sharedObject)
}

thread2.async {
    incrementCounter(sharedObject: sharedObject)
}

// Wait for the threads to finish
thread1.sync {}
thread2.sync {}

// Check the final value of the counter
print("Final counter value: \(sharedObject.counter)")
```

In this example, we define a `SharedObject` class that contains a counter variable. We create a transactional memory using the `TransactionalMemory` class, and define a transactional block `incrementCounter` that increments the counter value within a transaction.

We then create two concurrent threads `thread1` and `thread2` using `DispatchQueue`. Within each thread, we call the `incrementCounter` function to increment the counter value. These operations are performed concurrently and safely due to the transactional memory.

Finally, we wait for the threads to finish using `sync` and print the final value of the counter.

By using transactional memory in Swift, we can achieve thread safety without the complexities of explicit locks or synchronization mechanisms. This enables easier and more reliable concurrent programming in Swift.
