In today's digital world, collaboration and document sharing are crucial for efficient team workflows. One of the most popular platforms for document storage and collaboration is Google Drive. In this blog post, we will explore how to integrate document sharing and collaboration functionality into a Swift application using Google Drive APIs.

## Prerequisites

Before integrating Google Drive into your Swift application, you will need:

- A Google account with Google Drive access.
- Xcode installed on your machine.
- Cocoapods installed for managing dependencies.

## Step 1: Set Up Google API Console

To access Google Drive APIs, you need to create a project in the Google API Console and enable Drive API.

1. Go to the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Enable the Drive API. Go to the **Library** section, search for "Drive API," and enable it.
4. Create credentials. Go to the **Credentials** section, click on **Create Credentials**, and choose **OAuth client ID**.
5. Configure the OAuth consent screen by providing an application name and authorized domains.
6. Select the `iOS` application type and enter the bundle identifier of your Swift application.
7. Download the generated `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.

## Step 2: Set Up Swift Project

1. Create a new Swift project in Xcode or open an existing one.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `pod init` to initialize Cocoapods in your project.
4. Open the `Podfile` and add the following dependencies:

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
target 'YourSwiftApp' do
    pod 'GoogleSignIn'
    pod 'GoogleAPIClientForREST/Drive'
end
```

5. Run `pod install` to install the dependencies.

## Step 3: Configure Google Sign-In

1. In Xcode, add the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file downloaded from the Google API Console to your project. Ensure it is added to the target.
2. Open the `AppDelegate.swift` file and add the following code:

```swift
import GoogleSignIn

// Add the following method to your AppDelegate class
func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                 didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    GIDSignIn.sharedInstance().clientID = "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>"
    return true
}

// Add the following method to your AppDelegate class
func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL,
                 options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey: Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
    return GIDSignIn.sharedInstance().handle(url)
}
```

Replace `<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>` with the client ID obtained from the Google API Console.

## Step 4: Implement Google Drive API

1. Create a new Swift file, e.g., `GoogleDriveAPI.swift`.
2. Import the required dependencies:

```swift
import GoogleAPIClientForREST
import GoogleSignIn
import GTMSessionFetcher
```

3. Add the following code to set up the Google Drive service instance:

```swift
let scopes = [kGTLRAuthScopeDrive]
let service = GTLRDriveService()
```

4. Implement the `signInToGoogle` method to initiate the Google Sign-In flow:

```swift
func signInToGoogle() {
    GIDSignIn.sharedInstance().scopes = scopes
    GIDSignIn.sharedInstance().signIn()
}
```

5. Implement the `queryFiles` method to fetch a list of files from Google Drive:

```swift
func queryFiles(completion: @escaping ([GTLRDrive_File]?, Error?) -> Void) {
    let query = GTLRDriveQuery_FilesList.query()
    query.pageSize = 10
    service.executeQuery(query) { (ticket, files, error) in
        completion((files as? GTLRDrive_FileList)?.files, error)
    }
}
```

6. Implement the `uploadFile` method to upload a file to Google Drive:

```swift
func uploadFile(_ fileURL: URL, mimeType: String, completion: @escaping (GTLRDrive_File?, Error?) -> Void) {
    let file = GTLRDrive_File()
    file.name = fileURL.lastPathComponent
    let uploadParameters = GTLRUploadParameters(fileURL: fileURL, mimeType: mimeType)
    let query = GTLRDriveQuery_FilesCreate.query(withObject: file, uploadParameters: uploadParameters)
    service.executeQuery(query) { (ticket, file, error) in
        completion(file as? GTLRDrive_File, error)
    }
}
```

These are just a few examples of what you can achieve with Google Drive API. You can explore the official documentation for more features and methods.

## Conclusion

Integrating document sharing and collaboration with Google Drive in a Swift application opens up a range of possibilities for enhanced team productivity. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily get started with Google Drive API integration in your Swift project. Happy coding!
