When working with user input in any programming language, it's crucial to ensure that the data is sanitized and normalized before using it in your application. In Swift, one powerful way to achieve this is by utilizing guard statements. 

### Why use guard statements?

Guard statements provide a concise and readable way to validate input and handle exceptional cases. They help to clean up your code and make it more readable by preventing nested if-else statements. Instead of writing complex conditional checks, guard statements allow you to exit the current scope early if certain conditions are not met.

### Input sanitization using guard statements

Sanitizing input involves removing or replacing potentially harmful or unwanted characters. For example, let's say you have an input string that should only contain alphanumeric characters. You can use a guard statement to check for any characters that are not alphanumeric and exit the scope if found.

```swift
func sanitizeInput(_ input: String) -> String? {
    for character in input {
        guard character.isLetter || character.isNumber else {
            return nil
        }
    }
    return input
}
```

In the above code, we iterate through each character in the input string. The guard statement checks if the character is either a letter or a number. If it's not, the function returns nil, indicating that the input is not valid.

### Input normalization using guard statements

Normalization involves transforming input into a consistent format. For instance, let's say you want to normalize a phone number by removing any non-digit characters and ensuring it has a specific length. You can use guard statements to achieve this.

```swift
func normalizePhoneNumber(_ phoneNumber: String) -> String? {
    let digits = phoneNumber.filter { $0.isNumber }
    
    guard digits.count == 10 else {
        return nil
    }
    
    return String(digits)
}
```

In the code above, we use the `filter` function to keep only the digits from the phone number. The guard statement checks if the resulting count of digits is exactly 10. If it's not, the function returns nil. Otherwise, it returns the normalized phone number.

### Conclusion

Guard statements are a powerful tool in Swift for input sanitization and normalization. By using guard statements, you can easily validate input and handle exceptional cases, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code. Incorporating them into your application can help prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure that your data is in the expected format.
