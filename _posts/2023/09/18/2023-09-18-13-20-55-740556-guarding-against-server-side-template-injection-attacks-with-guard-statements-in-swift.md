Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) attacks are a common security vulnerability where an attacker can inject malicious code into server-side templates, leading to arbitrary code execution. This can have severe consequences, including unauthorized data access and the ability to take control of the server.

In Swift, guard statements can be used to protect against SSTI attacks by validating and sanitizing user input before using it in server-side templates. Guard statements provide a concise way to check the validity of a condition and exit early if it fails.

Let's take a look at how we can use guard statements to guard against SSTI attacks in Swift.

## 1. Validate and Sanitize User Input

Before using user input in server-side templates, it's crucial to validate and sanitize the input to ensure it doesn't contain any malicious code. This can involve checking for specific patterns or using a sanitization library.

For instance, if we have a user input `name` that will be used in a template, we can validate it using regular expressions to ensure it only contains alphanumeric characters:

```swift
func validateName(_ name: String) -> Bool {
    let nameRegex = "^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$"
    let namePredicate = NSPredicate(format:"SELF MATCHES %@", nameRegex)
    return namePredicate.evaluate(with: name)
}
```

## 2. Guard Against SSTI Attacks using Guard Statements

Once we have validated the user input, we can use guard statements to ensure its safety before using it in server-side templates. 

```swift
func renderTemplate(withName name: String) -> String {
    guard validateName(name) else {
        print("Invalid name")
        return ""
    }

    // Render the template using the sanitized name
    let template = "Hello, \(name)!"
    return template
}
```

In the above example, we guard against SSTI attacks by ensuring the `name` parameter is valid. If the `name` fails the validation, we print an error message and return an empty string instead of rendering the template. This prevents any potential malicious code from being executed.

## 3. Use Additional Security Measures

Guard statements alone are not enough to protect against all types of SSTI attacks. It is important to use additional security measures such as input filtering, output encoding, and strict template evaluation policies.

Using a secure templating engine that automatically applies input filtering and output encoding can provide an added layer of protection against SSTI attacks.

## Conclusion

Guard statements are a valuable tool in protecting against SSTI attacks in Swift. By validating and sanitizing user input and using guard statements to ensure its safety, we can greatly reduce the risk of SSTI vulnerabilities in server-side templates.

Remember to always keep security in mind when handling user input and employ additional security measures to further safeguard your application against potential attacks.
