One of the essential features in any document-based app is the ability to undo and redo actions. This functionality allows users to revert changes and bring back previous states of their documents. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement undo and redo functionality in a Swift document-based app using the UndoManager class.

## Setting Up the Project

To get started, let's create a new Swift document-based app project in Xcode. This project template provides the necessary structure and components for building a document-based app.

## Managing Undo and Redo Operations

1. **Create an UndoManager instance**: The UndoManager class, provided by UIKit, manages the undo and redo operations. In your document view controller, create an instance of UndoManager.

```swift
let undoManager = UndoManager()
```

2. **Register undoable actions**: When the user performs actions that can be undone, such as modifying the document's content, register these actions with the undo manager.

```swift
// Example: Registering a document modification
undoManager.registerUndo(withTarget: self, handler: { targetSelf in
    targetSelf.modifyDocumentContent()
})
```

3. **Perform undo and redo**: Implement methods to perform undo and redo operations. Use the `undo()` and `redo()` methods of the undo manager to perform these actions.

```swift
// Example: Implementing an undo action
@IBAction func undoAction(_ sender: Any) {
    undoManager.undo()
}

// Example: Implementing a redo action
@IBAction func redoAction(_ sender: Any) {
    undoManager.redo()
}
```

## Enabling and Disabling Undo and Redo Buttons

To maintain a consistent user interface, we should enable or disable undo and redo buttons based on the availability of these operations.

1. **Update button states**: After each action, update the enabled state of undo and redo buttons based on the undo manager's canUndo and canRedo properties.

```swift
// Example: Updating button states
func updateButtonStates() {
    undoButton.isEnabled = undoManager.canUndo
    redoButton.isEnabled = undoManager.canRedo
}
```

2. **Observe undo manager's notification**: Register an observer to receive notifications when the undo manager's undo or redo stack changes. In the document view controller's `viewDidLoad()` method, add the following code:

```swift
// Example: Observing undo manager's notification
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(undoManagerDidChange), name: NSNotification.Name.NSUndoManagerDidUndoChange, object: undoManager)
```

3. **Handle undo manager change**: Implement a method that updates the button states whenever the undo manager's undo or redo stack changes.

```swift
// Example: Handling undo manager change
@objc func undoManagerDidChange(notification: NSNotification) {
    updateButtonStates()
}
```

## Conclusion

Implementing undo and redo functionality is crucial in a document-based app to provide users with a familiar and powerful way to manage changes. By utilizing the UndoManager class in Swift, you can easily incorporate undo and redo operations into your app. Remember to update button states and provide a smooth user experience.
