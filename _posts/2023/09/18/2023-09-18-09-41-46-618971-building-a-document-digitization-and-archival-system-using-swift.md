In today's digital age, businesses and organizations are moving away from physical paper documents and transitioning to digital files. This not only helps reduce clutter and saves physical space but also improves accessibility and provides a more efficient way of managing documents. In this blog post, we will explore how to build a document digitization and archival system using Swift.

## Why Choose Swift for Document Digitization?

Swift is a powerful programming language developed by Apple that allows developers to build robust and performant applications for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. With its clean syntax and strong type system, Swift is a perfect choice for developing a document digitization and archival system.

## Getting Started

To get started with building our document digitization and archival system, we first need to set up the project. Open Xcode and create a new macOS application project. Let's name it "DocArchiveSystem".

## Document Scanning and OCR

The first step in our document digitization process is scanning and extracting text from the documents. We can utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to convert the scanned documents into editable text.

```swift
import Vision

func performOCR(on image: UIImage, completion: @escaping (String) -> Void) {
    guard let ciImage = CIImage(image: image) else {
        completion("")
        return
    }
    
    let request = VNRecognizeTextRequest(completionHandler: { (request, error) in
        guard let observations = request.results as? [VNRecognizedTextObservation] else {
            completion("")
            return
        }
        
        let recognizedText = observations.compactMap { observation in
            return observation.topCandidates(1).first?.string
        }.joined(separator: "\n")
        
        completion(recognizedText)
    })
    
    let handler = VNImageRequestHandler(ciImage: ciImage, options: [:])
    
    do {
        try handler.perform([request])
    } catch {
        completion("")
    }
}
```

In the code snippet above, we use the Vision framework to perform OCR on the scanned image. The `performOCR` function takes an `UIImage` and a completion closure as parameters. It converts the image into a `CIImage`, creates a `VNRecognizeTextRequest`, and performs the recognition. Finally, it extracts the recognized text from the observations and passes it to the completion closure.

## Document Indexing and Storage

Once we have the extracted text, we need to index and store it for easy retrieval. We can utilize the SQLite database to store the document metadata, including the extracted text and any other relevant information.

```swift
import SQLite

class DocumentStore {
    private var db: Connection
    
    init() {
        let documentsPath = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(.documentDirectory, .userDomainMask, true)[0]
        let databasePath = "\(documentsPath)/docarchive.sqlite3"
        
        do {
            db = try Connection(databasePath)
            createTable()
        } catch {
            fatalError("Failed to connect to database: \(error)")
        }
    }
    
    private func createTable() {
        let documents = Table("documents")
        let id = Expression<Int64>("id")
        let fileName = Expression<String>("fileName")
        let text = Expression<String>("text")
        
        do {
            try db.run(documents.create(ifNotExists: true) { table in
                table.column(id, primaryKey: .autoincrement)
                table.column(fileName, unique: true)
                table.column(text)
            })
        } catch {
            fatalError("Failed to create table: \(error)")
        }
    }
    
    func storeDocument(fileName: String, text: String) {
        let documents = Table("documents")
        let fileNameColumn = Expression<String>("fileName")
        let textColumn = Expression<String>("text")
        
        do {
            try db.run(documents.insert(fileNameColumn <- fileName, textColumn <- text))
        } catch {
            fatalError("Failed to store document: \(error)")
        }
    }
}
```

In the code snippet above, we define a `DocumentStore` class that handles the SQLite database connection and operations. The `createTable` method creates a table named "documents" with columns for id, fileName, and text. The `storeDocument` method inserts a new document record into the table with the provided fileName and text.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to build a document digitization and archival system using Swift. We covered the document scanning and OCR process using Vision framework, as well as the document indexing and storage using SQLite database. With Swift's capabilities, you can further enhance the system to meet your specific business requirements.

By embracing digital documentation, businesses and organizations can improve efficiency, accessibility, and reduce physical storage costs. With the power of Swift, you have the tools to create a robust and efficient document digitization and archival system.
