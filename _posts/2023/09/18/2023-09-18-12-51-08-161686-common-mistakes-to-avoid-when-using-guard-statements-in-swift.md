In Swift, **guard statements** are a powerful tool that helps improve the readability and maintainability of code. They allow you to handle exceptional cases early, reducing nesting levels, and making your code more elegant. However, like any other language construct, guard statements can lead to mistakes if not used correctly. In this article, we will discuss some common mistakes to avoid when using guard statements in Swift. Let's dive in!

## 1. Forgetting to Include an Early Exit

The primary purpose of a guard statement is to exit early when a condition is not met. It's crucial to remember to include the necessary **early exit** code such as `return`, `throw`, or `continue` within the `else` block of a guard statement. Forgetting to provide an early exit may lead to executing the rest of the code block, resulting in unexpected behavior or even crashes.

```swift
func getUser(withID userID: String) -> User? {
    guard let userData = fetchData(forUserID: userID) else {
        // Without early exit, the code continues here,
        // which may lead to unexpected behavior.
        return nil
    }
    // Process user data further...
    return User(data: userData)
}
```

## 2. Negating Conditions Incorrectly

When using a guard statement, it's important to ensure that the condition being checked is **correctly negated**. The condition inside a guard statement should evaluate to `false` when you want the early exit to trigger. Incorrectly negating the condition or using the wrong comparison operator can lead to unexpected results.

```swift
func validateEmail(_ email: String) -> Bool {
    guard !email.isEmpty else {
        // Incorrectly negating the condition
        // may lead to unexpected results.

        // Instead, use:
        // guard email.isEmpty else {
        //     return false
        // }
        return true
    }
    // Validate email further...
    return isValidEmail(email)
}
```
