In the world of app development, network connectivity issues and API failures can be a common occurrence. These issues can disrupt the user experience and even cause crashes if not handled properly. In Swift, one way to guard against such failures is to use `guard` statements.

`guard` statements in Swift provide a concise way to check if a condition is met, and if not, execute a block of code that handles the failure. This can be particularly useful when dealing with network requests and API responses.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use `guard` statements to handle network and API failures in Swift:

```swift
func fetchDataFromAPI() {
    guard let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/data") else {
        print("Invalid URL")
        return
    }
    
    let request = URLRequest(url: url)
    
    URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { (data, response, error) in
        guard error == nil else {
            print("Network request failed: \(error!.localizedDescription)")
            return
        }
        
        guard let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse else {
            print("Invalid HTTP response")
            return
        }
        
        guard (200...299).contains(httpResponse.statusCode) else {
            print("API request failed with status code: \(httpResponse.statusCode)")
            return
        }
        
        // Process the data returned from the API
        if let data = data {
            // Parse the data and update the UI
            // ...
        }
    }.resume()
}
```

In the `fetchDataFromAPI` function, we start by using a `guard` statement to ensure that the URL we construct from the API endpoint is valid. If the URL is invalid, we print an error message and return early.

Next, we create a `URLRequest` object and initiate a data task using `URLSession.shared.dataTask(with:completionHandler:)`. Inside the completion handler of the data task, we continue to use `guard` statements to handle potential failures.

We first check if there is any network error. If an error exists, we print the error message and return. Then, we ensure that the response received is of type `HTTPURLResponse`. If not, we print an error message and return.

Finally, we check if the API request was successful by verifying that the status code falls within the range 200 to 299 (indicating a successful response). If the status code is outside this range, we print an error message and return.

If all the `guard` conditions pass, we can safely process the data returned from the API, such as parsing the JSON data and updating the UI accordingly.

By using `guard` statements, we can effectively handle network and API failures, and also keep our code more readable and structured. It allows for better error handling and fail-fast behavior, ensuring that potential issues are caught early in the execution flow.
