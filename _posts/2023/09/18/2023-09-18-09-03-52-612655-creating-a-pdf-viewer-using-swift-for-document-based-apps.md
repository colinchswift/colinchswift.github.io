If you're developing a document-based app with Swift, you might need to incorporate a PDF viewer to allow your users to view PDF documents within your application. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to create a simple PDF viewer using Swift.

## Getting Started

To get started, create a new Swift project in Xcode or open an existing project that you want to add the PDF viewer to. 

## Adding PDFKit Framework

The first step is to add the PDFKit framework to your project. To do this, navigate to the Project Navigator in Xcode, select your project, and choose the "General" tab. Under the "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" section, click the "+" button and search for "PDFKit". Select the PDFKit framework and click "Add".

## Displaying a PDF Document

After adding the PDFKit framework, you can now display a PDF document within your app. Start by creating an instance of `PDFView` and adding it to your view hierarchy. 

```swift
import PDFKit

// Create a PDFView and add it to your view hierarchy
let pdfView = PDFView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: view.frame.width, height: view.frame.height))
view.addSubview(pdfView)
```

Next, you can load the PDF document you want to display using the `PDFView` instance. 

```swift
if let pdfURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "example", withExtension: "pdf") {
    if let document = PDFDocument(url: pdfURL) {
        pdfView.document = document
    }
}
```

Make sure to replace `"example"` with the name of your PDF file.

## Customizing PDF Viewer

You can further customize the PDF viewer by modifying properties of the `PDFView` instance. For example, you can set the display mode to single page or continuous scrolling mode:

```swift
pdfView.displayMode = .singlePageContinuous
```

You can also enable or disable page snapping:

```swift
pdfView.enablePageSnapping = true
```

Feel free to explore the documentation for `PDFView` and its properties to customize the viewer according to your app's needs.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a PDF viewer using Swift for document-based apps. By leveraging the PDFKit framework, we were able to display PDF documents within our app and customize the viewer to suit our requirements. Now you can enhance your document-based app by incorporating a PDF viewer for a seamless reading experience.
