In Swift, if you have a set of tasks that need to be executed in parallel and you want to wait until all the tasks are completed before continuing, you can leverage the power of `DispatchGroup`. `DispatchGroup` allows you to efficiently manage and synchronize multiple tasks by grouping them together.

Let's take a look at an example scenario where you have an array of URLs and want to fetch the content of each URL concurrently. Here's how you can achieve this using `DispatchGroup`:

```swift
import Foundation

func fetchData(for urls: [URL], completion: @escaping ([Data]) -> Void) {
    let dispatchGroup = DispatchGroup()
    var fetchedData = [Data]()
    
    for url in urls {
        dispatchGroup.enter()
        
        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, _, _) in
            if let data = data {
                fetchedData.append(data)
            }
            dispatchGroup.leave()
        }.resume()
    }
    
    dispatchGroup.notify(queue: .main) {
        completion(fetchedData)
    }
}

let urls = [URL(string: "https://example.com/1")!, URL(string: "https://example.com/2")!, URL(string: "https://example.com/3")!]
fetchData(for: urls) { (data) in
    // Handle fetched data
}
```

In this example, we create a `DispatchGroup` named `dispatchGroup` and an array `fetchedData` to store the fetched content. 

Inside the loop, we call `enter()` before starting each data task, indicating that a new task is being added to the group. Then, inside the completion closure of the data task, we call `leave()` to indicate that the task has finished.

After the loop, we call `notify(queue:)` on the `dispatchGroup` object to specify what needs to be done when all the tasks in the group have completed. In this case, we pass the `.main` queue and call the `completion` closure to handle the fetched data.

With `DispatchGroup`, the tasks are executed concurrently, allowing for efficient parallelization of the fetch operations. The `notify(queue:)` method ensures that the completion closure is only called when all tasks have completed, eliminating the need for manual tracking of task completion.

By utilizing `DispatchGroup`, you can efficiently parallelize tasks in Swift and achieve better performance when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations.
