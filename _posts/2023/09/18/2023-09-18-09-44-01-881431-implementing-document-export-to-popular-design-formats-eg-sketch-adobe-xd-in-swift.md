As a developer, you may often encounter the need to export documents to popular design formats such as Sketch or Adobe XD. In this blog post, we will explore how to achieve this using Swift, a powerful and versatile programming language for iOS, macOS, and beyond.

## The Sketch and Adobe XD Formats

Before we dive into the implementation, let's briefly discuss the document formats we aim to export our content to:

1. Sketch: Sketch is a vector-based design tool widely used by designers. It utilizes the .sketch file format, which contains layers, artboards, vector shapes, and other design elements.

2. Adobe XD: Adobe XD is another popular design and prototyping tool. It employs the .xd file format, which includes artboards, vectors, grids, and interactive components.

## Exporting to Sketch Format

To export your content to the Sketch format, you can make use of third-party libraries such as `SketchExportSwift`. This library provides an easy-to-use API to generate Sketch-compatible documents programmatically.

Here's an example code snippet on how to export a document to Sketch format using `SketchExportSwift`:

```swift
import SketchExportSwift

func exportToSketch(document: Document) {
    let sketchExport = SketchExport()
    let sketchDocument = sketchExport.createNewDocument()
    
    // Export each layer to Sketch
    for layer in document.layers {
        let sketchLayer = sketchDocument.addLayer()
        sketchLayer.name = layer.name
        sketchLayer.position = CGPoint(x: layer.x, y: layer.y)
        sketchLayer.size = CGSize(width: layer.width, height: layer.height)
        
        // Customize layer properties, styles, etc.
        // ...
    }
    
    // Export the document to a .sketch file
    sketchExport.export(to: "path/to/export.sketch", document: sketchDocument)
}
```

In the above code, we first create a new Sketch document using `sketchExport.createNewDocument()`. Next, we iterate through our document's layers and add them to the Sketch document using the `addLayer()` method. Finally, we export the Sketch document to a .sketch file using the `export(to:document:)` method.

## Exporting to Adobe XD Format

To export your content to the Adobe XD format, you can utilize the Adobe XD API provided by Adobe. This API allows you to programmatically generate XD-compatible files.

Below is an example code snippet for exporting a document to Adobe XD format:

```swift
import XDExportSwift

func exportToAdobeXD(document: Document) {
    let xdExport = XDExport()
    let xdArtboard = xdExport.createArtboard()
    
    // Export each layer to Adobe XD artboard
    for layer in document.layers {
        let xdLayer = xdArtboard.addLayer()
        xdLayer.name = layer.name
        xdLayer.position = CGPoint(x: layer.x, y: layer.y)
        xdLayer.size = CGSize(width: layer.width, height: layer.height)
        
        // Customize layer properties, styles, etc.
        // ...
    }
    
    // Export the artboard to an .xd file
    xdExport.export(to: "path/to/export.xd", artboard: xdArtboard)
}
```

In the above code, we create a new Adobe XD artboard using `xdExport.createArtboard()`. We then iterate through our document's layers and add them to the artboard using the `addLayer()` method. Finally, we export the artboard to an .xd file using the `export(to:artboard:)` method.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement document export to popular design formats such as Sketch and Adobe XD using Swift. By utilizing third-party libraries like `SketchExportSwift` and Adobe's XD API, you can export your documents programmatically and seamlessly integrate them into your design workflow.

Remember to check out the documentation and examples provided by each library and API for a more comprehensive understanding of their capabilities. Happy coding!
