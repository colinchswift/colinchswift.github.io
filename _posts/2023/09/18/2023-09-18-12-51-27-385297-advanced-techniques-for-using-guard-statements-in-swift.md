Guard statements are powerful tools for adding robustness and clarity to Swift code. While their basic usage is widely known, there are some advanced techniques that can maximize the benefits of using guard statements. In this blog post, we will explore these techniques to level up your guard statement usage.

## 1. Early Return with Custom Error Handling

Guard statements are commonly used to exit early from a function or method when conditions are not met. However, you can also use them for custom error handling. By creating your own error enums and throwing them inside guard statements, you can have more control over the error handling process.

```swift
enum LoginError: Error {
    case invalidCredentials
    case accountLocked
    case serverUnavailable
}

func login(username: String?, password: String?) throws {
    guard let username = username, let password = password else {
        throw LoginError.invalidCredentials
    }

    guard !isAccountLocked(username) else {
        throw LoginError.accountLocked
    }

    guard isServerAvailable() else {
        throw LoginError.serverUnavailable
    }

    // Perform the login logic
    // ...
}
```

In the above example, the guard statements are used to validate the username, check if the account is locked, and verify if the server is available. If any of these conditions fail, a custom error is thrown using the guard statement.

## 2. Unwrapping Multiple Optionals

Guard statements can also be used to safely unwrap multiple optionals and perform further operations if all the unwrappings are successful. This technique eliminates the need for nested if-let statements.

```swift
func fetchDataFromAPI() {
    guard let user = getCurrentUser(),
          let token = getAccessToken(),
          let endpoint = getAPIEndpoint() else {
        return
    }

    // Use the unwrapped values
    // ...
}
```

In the above example, the guard statement is used to unwrap `user`, `token`, and `endpoint`. If any of these values are `nil`, the execution flow is immediately returned and the subsequent code is not executed. This results in cleaner and more readable code.

## Conclusion

Guard statements are powerful constructs in Swift that can greatly improve the robustness and readability of your code. By using advanced techniques like custom error handling and unwrapping multiple optionals, you can take full advantage of guard statements and write more elegant and efficient code.
