In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of creating a document translation tool with language detection capabilities using the Swift programming language. This tool will be able to identify the language of a given document and provide a translated version.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Xcode IDE
- Swift programming language

## Setting up the Project

1. Open Xcode and create a new Swift project.
2. Choose an appropriate name and location for your project.
3. Once the project is created, go to the project settings and add the necessary resources for language detection and translation.

## Adding Language Detection

To implement language detection in our project, we will be utilizing a machine learning library called Natural Language Processing (NLP). 

1. Import the NLP framework into your project by adding the following code at the top of your Swift file:
```swift
import NaturalLanguage
```

2. Next, we can use the `NLLanguageRecognizer` class provided by the NLP framework to detect the language of a given document. Here's an example implementation:
```swift
let text = "This is a sample document."
let recognizer = NLLanguageRecognizer()
recognizer.processString(text)
let language = recognizer.dominantLanguage?.rawValue
```
In the above code, we first create an instance of `NLLanguageRecognizer` and then process the input text using the `processString` method. Finally, we retrieve the dominant language detected using the `dominantLanguage` property.

## Integrating Translation API

To provide translation functionality, we can utilize a translation API such as Google Translate or Microsoft Translator. 

1. Sign up for an API key with your preferred translation service provider.
2. Add the necessary API integration code to your project as per the documentation provided by the service provider.

## Implementing Translation

Once we have set up the translation API, we can implement the translation functionality in our project. Here's an example implementation using Google Translate API:

```swift
import Alamofire // Assuming you are using Alamofire for network requests

let sourceText = "This is a sample document."
let targetLanguage = "fr" // Target language code for French

let headers = [
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
]

let parameters = [
    "source": "en",
    "target": targetLanguage,
    "q": [sourceText]
]

AF.request("https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2", method: .post, parameters: parameters, encoding: JSONEncoding.default, headers: headers).responseJSON { response in
    switch response.result {
    case .success(let value):
        let json = JSON(value)
        if let translatedText = json["data"]["translations"][0]["translatedText"].string {
            print("Translated Text: \(translatedText)")
        }
    case .failure(let error):
        print("Error: \(error)")
    }
}
```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key obtained from the translation service provider.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to create a document translation tool with language detection using Swift. We integrated the NLP framework for language detection and a translation API for the actual translation. You can further enhance this tool by adding user interfaces and additional features according to your requirements.
