In today's digital world, **security** is of utmost importance. Whether you are building a document management system, a cloud storage app, or any application that deals with sensitive information, it is crucial to ensure the **confidentiality and integrity** of the stored documents. In this blog post, we will explore how to achieve secure document storage and encryption in Swift.

## Document Storage

When storing documents securely, one option is to leverage the power of **iOS Keychain**. The iOS Keychain provides a secure and encrypted storage space for sensitive information such as passwords, cryptographic keys, and certificates. While it is primarily designed for storing credentials, it can also be used to securely store documents.

To store a document in the iOS Keychain, you can convert the document into a **Data** object and store it as a secure item. Let's see how this can be done:

```swift
import Foundation
import Security

func storeDocumentInKeychain(document: Data, identifier: String) -> Bool {
    let query: [String: Any] = [
        kSecClass as String: kSecClassGenericPassword,
        kSecAttrAccount as String: identifier,
        kSecValueData as String: document,
        kSecAttrAccessible as String: kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly
    ]
  
    let status = SecItemAdd(query as CFDictionary, nil)
    return status == errSecSuccess
}
```

In the code above, we define a function `storeDocumentInKeychain` that takes the document as a `Data` object and an identifier to uniquely identify the document in the keychain. We create a dictionary that contains the necessary attributes for storing the document as a secure item. The attribute `kSecAttrAccessible` defines when the document is accessible, in this case, when the device is unlocked. Finally, we use `SecItemAdd` to add the document to the keychain.

## Document Encryption

While storing documents in the Keychain provides some level of security, we can further enhance the security by encrypting the document before storing it. One popular encryption algorithm is **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**. AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for secure data transmission and storage.

To encrypt a document using AES in Swift, we can use the **CryptoKit** framework introduced in iOS 13 and macOS 10.15. Here's an example of how to encrypt a document:

```swift
import CryptoKit

func encryptDocument(document: Data, key: SymmetricKey) throws -> Data {
    let sealedBox = try AES.GCM.seal(document, using: key)
    return sealedBox.combined
}

func decryptDocument(document: Data, key: SymmetricKey) throws -> Data {
    let sealedBox = try AES.GCM.SealedBox(combined: document)
    return try AES.GCM.open(sealedBox, using: key)
}
```

In the code above, we define two functions; `encryptDocument` and `decryptDocument`. The `encryptDocument` function takes a document as a `Data` object and a symmetric key as input. It uses AES in GCM mode to encrypt the document and returns the encrypted data. The `decryptDocument` function reverses this process by taking encrypted data and a symmetric key, decrypting the data, and returning the original document.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have explored how to achieve secure document storage and encryption in Swift. We saw how to store documents securely using the iOS Keychain and how to further enhance the security by encrypting the documents with AES. By implementing these techniques, you can ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your stored documents, providing peace of mind to your users.
