In Swift, it's essential to sanitize and properly handle user input to prevent code injection and improve application security. One way to achieve this is by using guard statements to validate and encode user input. Guard statements help ensure that the data we receive is of the expected format and does not contain any malicious characters.

Let's take a look at an example of using guard statements for input encoding and escaping in Swift:

```swift
func validateInput(_ input: String) -> String {
    // Ensure the input is not empty
    guard !input.isEmpty else { return "" }
    
    // Encode special characters in the input
    guard let encodedInput = input.addingPercentEncoding(withAllowedCharacters: .urlQueryAllowed) else { return "" }
    
    // Escape HTML entities in the input
    let escapedInput = encodedInput.replacingOccurrences(of: "&", with: "&amp;")
        .replacingOccurrences(of: "<", with: "&lt;")
        .replacingOccurrences(of: ">", with: "&gt;")
        .replacingOccurrences(of: "\"", with: "&quot;")
        .replacingOccurrences(of: "'", with: "&#39;")
    
    return escapedInput
}

// Usage
let userInput = "Hello <world>!"
let validatedInput = validateInput(userInput)
print(validatedInput)
```

In the code snippet above, we have a `validateInput` function that takes a string as input and returns the sanitized version of the input. Here's what the process looks like:

1. The first guard statement checks if the input is empty. If it is, we return an empty string since we don't want to proceed with empty input.

2. The `addingPercentEncoding` method is then used to encode any special characters present in the input. This step is crucial to prevent code injection attacks and other vulnerabilities. It replaces characters like spaces, brackets, ampersands, etc., with their URL-encoded representations.

3. Finally, we use the `replacingOccurrences` method to escape HTML entities in the encoded input. This step ensures that any HTML tags or special characters are safely escaped and do not get interpreted as code when rendered in an HTML context.

The result of the `validateInput` function is the sanitized and escaped version of the user input, which can then be safely used in various contexts such as displaying on a webpage or storing in a database.

By using guard statements in this manner, we can ensure that the input we receive is properly encoded and escaped, reducing the risk of code injection and improving the security of our Swift applications.
