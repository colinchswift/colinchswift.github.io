If you are building a document-based app in Swift, you might want to provide users with the capability to **export** and **import** their documents. By implementing these features, users can save their documents to external storage or share them with other apps. In this blog post, we will explore how to add export and import functionality to your document-based application in Swift.

## Exporting Documents

To enable document export in your Swift app, follow these steps:

1. **Add an Export Button**: Add a button to the user interface that will trigger the export process.

2. **Implement Export Code**: When the export button is tapped, implement the code that handles the export process. You can use the `UIDocumentPickerViewController` to present the document picker interface, which allows users to choose a destination for exporting the document.

    ```swift
    import UIKit

    class DocumentViewController: UIDocumentViewController {

        // Export button action
        @IBAction func exportButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
            let exportPicker = UIDocumentPickerViewController(documentTypes: ["com.example.myapp"], in: .exportToService)
            exportPicker.delegate = self
            present(exportPicker, animated: true, completion: nil)
        }

        // Export delegate methods
        // ...

    }
    ```

3. **Implement Document Export Delegate Methods**: Implement the delegate methods of the `UIDocumentPickerDelegate` protocol to handle the user's chosen export destination and perform the necessary export operations.

```swift
import UIKit

class DocumentViewController: UIDocumentViewController, UIDocumentPickerDelegate {

    // Export button action
    @IBAction func exportButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
        let exportPicker = UIDocumentPickerViewController(documentTypes: ["com.example.myapp"], in: .exportToService)
        exportPicker.delegate = self
        present(exportPicker, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }

    // Export delegate methods
    func documentPicker(_ controller: UIDocumentPickerViewController, didPickDocumentsAt urls: [URL]) {
        guard let exportURL = urls.first else { return }

        // Perform export operations using the exportURL
        // ...

        // Optionally notify the user about the export success or failure
        // ...
    }

    func documentPickerWasCancelled(_ controller: UIDocumentPickerViewController) {
        // Handle export cancellation
        // ...
    }

}
```

With these steps in place, your users will be able to export their documents to various destinations supported by the `UIDocumentPickerViewController`.

## Importing Documents

To provide document import functionality in your Swift app, follow these steps:

1. **Add an Import Button**: Add a button to the user interface that triggers the import process.

2. **Implement Import Code**: When the import button is tapped, implement the code that handles the document import process. Again, you can use the `UIDocumentPickerViewController` to present the document picker interface.

```swift
import UIKit

class DocumentViewController: UIDocumentViewController, UIDocumentPickerDelegate {

    // Import button action
    @IBAction func importButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
        let importPicker = UIDocumentPickerViewController(documentTypes: ["public.data"], in: .open)
        importPicker.delegate = self
        importPicker.allowsMultipleSelection = false
        present(importPicker, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }

    // Import delegate methods
    func documentPicker(_ controller: UIDocumentPickerViewController, didPickDocumentsAt urls: [URL]) {
        guard let importURL = urls.first else { return }

        // Perform import operations using the importURL
        // ...

        // Optionally notify the user about the import success or failure
        // ...
    }

    func documentPickerWasCancelled(_ controller: UIDocumentPickerViewController) {
        // Handle import cancellation
        // ...
    }

}
```

3. **Implement Import Delegate Methods**: Implement the delegate methods of the `UIDocumentPickerDelegate` protocol to handle the chosen import document(s) and perform the necessary import operations.

With these steps completed, your users will be able to import documents into your Swift document-based app using the `UIDocumentPickerViewController`.

In summary, by implementing export and import features in your Swift document-based apps, you enhance the user experience and make it easier for users to work with their documents. With the help of the `UIDocumentPickerViewController` class and its delegate methods, you can allow users to export their documents to external storage or import documents from other apps seamlessly. ##hashtags #Swift #iOSDevelopment
