## Introduction

In today's tech-savvy world, users have come to expect efficient search and filtering functionalities in their applications. Whether it's searching for documents based on keywords or filtering data based on specific criteria, these features greatly enhance the usability and user experience of an app. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement search and filtering features in Swift document-based apps.

## Searching Documents

To implement search functionality in a Swift document-based app, we can leverage the power of `NSPredicate` and `NSMetadataQuery` classes provided by Apple's Foundation framework. Here's an example code snippet to perform a search on documents based on keywords:

```swift
import Foundation

func searchDocumentsForKeyword(keyword: String) {
    let query = NSMetadataQuery()
    query.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "kMDItemTextContent LIKE[c] %@", "*\(keyword)*")
    query.searchScopes = [NSMetadataQueryIndexedLocalComputerScope]
    
    NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(forName: NSNotification.Name.NSMetadataQueryDidFinishGathering, object: query, queue: nil) { (notification) in
        query.disableUpdates()
        
        let results = query.results as! [NSMetadataItem]
        for item in results {
            // Handle search results
        }
        
        NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(self, name: NSNotification.Name.NSMetadataQueryDidFinishGathering, object: query)
    }
    
    query.start()
}
```
The above code creates an instance of `NSMetadataQuery`, sets the search scope to local computer, and defines a predicate to match documents containing the given keyword. Once the query finishes gathering the search results, we can iterate over the `NSMetadataItems` to handle the search results accordingly.

## Filtering Data

To implement filtering functionality in a Swift document-based app, we can utilize various techniques depending on the type of data we are working with. Here's an example code snippet to filter an array of custom objects based on a specific criteria:

```swift
struct Person {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
}

let people = [
    Person(name: "John", age: 25),
    Person(name: "Emily", age: 30),
    Person(name: "Michael", age: 40)
]

let filteredPeople = people.filter { $0.age >= 30 }
```

In the above code, we have an array of `Person` objects. We use the `filter` method on the array and provide a closure to define the filtering criteria. In this case, we filter the array to include only people with an age of 30 or above.

## Conclusion

Implementing search and filtering features in Swift document-based apps can greatly enhance their usability and user experience. Whether it's searching for documents based on keywords or filtering data based on specific criteria, these features empower users to efficiently find what they are looking for. By leveraging the power of `NSPredicate`, `NSMetadataQuery`, and other Swift functionality, developers can easily incorporate these features in their apps. So, go ahead and make your apps more user-friendly by including these search and filtering capabilities!
