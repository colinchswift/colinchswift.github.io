In today's increasingly connected world, it is common to interact with various web APIs to fetch and manipulate data. One common use case is importing and manipulating documents from RESTful APIs in Swift. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement this functionality using Swift.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Project
To get started, create a new Swift project in Xcode and ensure that you have network access permissions in your app's `Info.plist` file.

## Step 2: Networking with URLSession
Swift provides the `URLSession` class that allows you to make network requests. Create a function to fetch the document from the web API:

```swift
func fetchDocument(url: URL, completion: @escaping (Data?, Error?) -> Void) {
    URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in
        if let error = error {
            completion(nil, error)
            return
        }
        
        completion(data, nil)
    }.resume()
}
```

The function above uses URLSession's `dataTask(with:completionHandler:)` method to make an asynchronous HTTP request and fetch the document data. It handles both success and error cases through the completion closure.

## Step 3: Document Manipulation
Once you have fetched the document data, you can proceed with manipulating it based on your requirements. For example, let's assume we want to extract the text content from a JSON-based document:

```swift
func extractText(from documentData: Data) -> String? {
    do {
        let json = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: documentData, options: [])
        if let document = json as? [String: Any],
           let text = document["text"] as? String {
            return text
        }
    } catch {
        print("Error extracting text: \(error)")
    }
    
    return nil
}
```

The `extractText(from:)` function above utilizes Swift's `JSONSerialization` class to parse the document data as JSON and extract the relevant text content from the document.

## Step 4: Putting It All Together
To import and manipulate a document from a web API, call the previously defined functions in a relevant context. For instance, let's assume you have a button where the user can trigger the document import:

```swift
@IBAction func importButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
    guard let documentURL = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/documents/123") else { return }
    
    fetchDocument(url: documentURL) { (data, error) in
        if let error = error {
            print("Error fetching document: \(error)")
            return
        }
        
        if let documentData = data {
            if let extractedText = extractText(from: documentData) {
                // Do something with the extracted text
                print("Extracted text: \(extractedText)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the example code above, we assume that the button is connected to an `IBAction` function named `importButtonTapped`. Inside this function, we fetch the document, extract the text, and perform further actions with the extracted text.

## Conclusion
By following the steps outlined above, you can easily implement document import and manipulation from web APIs in Swift. This enables you to fetch documents, perform necessary transformations, and incorporate the data into your app's functionality. Stay connected with web APIs to achieve dynamic and up-to-date document handling in your Swift projects.
