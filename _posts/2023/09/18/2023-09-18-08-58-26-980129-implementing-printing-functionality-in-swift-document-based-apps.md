Printing functionality is essential in document-based apps as it allows users to easily obtain physical copies of their documents. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement printing functionality in Swift, focusing on document-based apps using `UIPrintInteractionController`.

## Step 1: Setting up the print button

To begin, we need to provide a way for users to initiate the printing process. You can add a print button to your app's user interface, such as in a toolbar or navigation bar.

```swift
let printButton = UIBarButtonItem(title: "Print", style: .plain, target: self, action: #selector(printButtonTapped))
navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = printButton
```

Make sure to set the target and action to your desired method that will handle the printing functionality.

## Step 2: Handling the print button tap

In the `printButtonTapped` method, we will present the print interaction controller to the user.

```swift
@objc func printButtonTapped() {
    guard UIPrintInteractionController.isPrintingAvailable else {
        print("Printing is not available.")
        return
    }
  
    let printInfo = UIPrintInfo.printInfo()
    printInfo.outputType = .general
    printInfo.jobName = "My Document"
    
    let printInteractionController = UIPrintInteractionController.shared
    printInteractionController.printInfo = printInfo
    printInteractionController.printingItem = document.fileURL
    
    printInteractionController.present(from: self.view.bounds, in: self.view, animated: true) { (_, completed, error) in
        if completed {
            print("Printing completed successfully.")
        } else if let error = error {
            print("Printing failed with error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        } else {
            print("Printing was canceled.")
        }
    }
}
```

In the code above, we first check if printing is available on the current device. If not, we display an error message.

Next, we create a `UIPrintInfo` object to specify details about the printing job, such as the output type and job name.

Then, we create an instance of `UIPrintInteractionController` and set the `printInfo` and `printingItem` properties. The `printingItem` should be an instance of `NSURL` representing the document's file URL.

Finally, we present the print interaction controller to the user. In the completion block, we handle various scenarios such as successful printing, printing errors, or cancellation.

## Step 3: Handling page layout and customization

You can customize the page layout and appearance of the printed document by modifying the `UIPrintPageRenderer` class. This allows you to add headers, footers, and other layout elements.

To customize the page layout, subclass `UIPrintPageRenderer` and override its methods. For example:

```swift
class CustomPrintPageRenderer: UIPrintPageRenderer {

    override func drawHeaderForPage(at pageIndex: Int, in printableRect: CGRect) {
        let headerText = "My Custom Header"
        let headerRect = CGRect(x: printableRect.minX, y: printableRect.minY, width: printableRect.width, height: 50)
      
        let paragraphStyle = NSMutableParagraphStyle()
        paragraphStyle.alignment = .center
      
        let font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 14)
        let attributes: [NSAttributedString.Key: Any] = [
            .font: font,
            .paragraphStyle: paragraphStyle
        ]
      
        headerText.draw(in: headerRect, withAttributes: attributes)
    }
  
    override func drawFooterForPage(at pageIndex: Int, in printableRect: CGRect) {
        let footerText = "Page \(pageIndex + 1)"
        let footerRect = CGRect(x: printableRect.minX, y: printableRect.maxY - 20, width: printableRect.width, height: 20)
      
        let paragraphStyle = NSMutableParagraphStyle()
        paragraphStyle.alignment = .right
      
        let font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 10)
        let attributes: [NSAttributedString.Key: Any] = [
            .font: font,
            .paragraphStyle: paragraphStyle
        ]
      
        footerText.draw(in: footerRect, withAttributes: attributes)
    }
}
```

In the code above, we override the `drawHeaderForPage` and `drawFooterForPage` methods to draw custom headers and footers for each page.

To use the custom print renderer, modify the `printInteractionController` instantiation as follows:

```swift
let printInteractionController = UIPrintInteractionController.shared
printInteractionController.printInfo = printInfo
printInteractionController.printPageRenderer = CustomPrintPageRenderer()
```

Now, when the user triggers the print button, the custom print renderer will be used, providing a customized layout for the printed document.

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can implement printing functionality in your document-based Swift apps. Users will be able to easily print their documents, customize the print layout, and obtain physical copies of their work. Don't forget to test the printing functionality on different devices and ensure compatibility with different paper sizes and orientations.
