In Swift, guards are an essential tool for handling optional values and ensuring that a certain condition is met before proceeding with the rest of the code. While Swift provides some built-in guard statements, you can also create your own custom guards to handle more specific scenarios.

## Why use custom guards?

Custom guards can help you enforce specific conditions and provide a clear and concise way to handle edge cases. By creating custom guards, you can encapsulate your custom logic and avoid cluttering your main code with conditional statements. This improves code readability and maintainability.

## How to implement custom guards?

To implement a custom guard in Swift, follow these steps:

1. Define a custom guard function:
   ```swift
   func customGuard(_ condition: Bool, errorMessage: String) {
       guard condition else {
           fatalError(errorMessage)
       }
   }
   ```

2. Use the custom guard function in your code:
   ```swift
   func processOrder(_ order: Order?) {
       customGuard(order != nil, errorMessage: "Order is nil!")
       // Rest of the code
   }
   ```

In the example above, we define a custom `customGuard` function that takes a condition and an error message. If the condition evaluates to `false`, the function calls `fatalError` with the specified error message.

We then use the `customGuard` function within the `processOrder` function to ensure that the `order` parameter is not `nil` before proceeding with the rest of the code. If the condition fails, the program terminates with an error message.

## Benefits of using custom guards

- **Code encapsulation:** Custom guards allow you to encapsulate your custom validation logic in a separate function, making your main code cleaner and easier to understand.

- **Readability and maintainability:** By using custom guards, you can remove complex nested `if` statements and make your code more readable. This also improves code maintainability as changes to the validation logic can be made in a single place.

- **Specific error messages:** Custom guards allow you to provide specific error messages when a condition fails. This helps with debugging and provides meaningful feedback to developers in case of unexpected scenarios.

## Conclusion

Custom guards are a powerful feature in Swift that allow you to handle specific conditions and improve code readability and maintainability. By encapsulating custom validation logic in separate functions, you can streamline your code and provide clear error messages. Consider using custom guards in your Swift projects to enforce specific conditions and handle optional values effectively.
