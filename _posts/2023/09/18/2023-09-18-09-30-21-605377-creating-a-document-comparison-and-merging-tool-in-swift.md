Are you tired of manually comparing and merging multiple versions of a document? In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of creating a document comparison and merging tool in Swift. This tool will save you time and effort by automating the process of comparing and merging documents. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Xcode installed on your machine
- Basic knowledge of Swift programming language

## Step 1: Setting Up the Project

1. Open Xcode and create a new project.
2. Select "Single View App" as the template for your project.
3. Enter a name for your project and choose the desired options.
4. Click "Next" and select a location to save your project.
5. Click "Create" to create the project.

## Step 2: Adding the Document Comparison Functionality

1. Create a new Swift file called "DocumentComparer.swift" in your project.
2. Open the file and define a class called `DocumentComparer`.
3. Add a function called `compareDocuments` that takes two `String` parameters representing the paths to the two documents you want to compare.
4. Within the `compareDocuments` function, read the contents of the two documents using the `String(contentsOfFile:)` method.
5. Perform a comparison of the two documents using any suitable algorithm or library of your choice.

```swift
class DocumentComparer {
    func compareDocuments(document1Path: String, document2Path: String) {
        do {
            let document1Content = try String(contentsOfFile: document1Path)
            let document2Content = try String(contentsOfFile: document2Path)
            
            // Perform document comparison here
            
        } catch {
            print("Error reading document contents: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Adding the Document Merging Functionality

1. Add another function called `mergeDocuments` to the `DocumentComparer` class.
2. This function should take three `String` parameters - the paths to the two documents to be merged and the output path for the merged document.
3. Read the contents of the two documents in the same way as done in the `compareDocuments` function.
4. Perform the necessary merging logic to combine the contents of the two documents.
5. Write the merged document contents to the output file using the `write(toFile:atomically:encoding:)` method.

```swift
class DocumentComparer {
    // Existing code
    
    func mergeDocuments(document1Path: String, document2Path: String, outputPath: String) {
        do {
            let document1Content = try String(contentsOfFile: document1Path)
            let document2Content = try String(contentsOfFile: document2Path)
            
            // Perform document merging here
            
            try document1Content.write(toFile: outputPath, atomically: true, encoding: .utf8)
        } catch {
            print("Error merging documents: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully created a document comparison and merging tool in Swift. This tool will greatly simplify the process of comparing and merging documents, saving you time and effort. Feel free to further enhance the tool by adding additional features or integrating it into an existing app. Happy coding!
