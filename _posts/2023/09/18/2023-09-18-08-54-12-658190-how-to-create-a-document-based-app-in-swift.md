Document-based apps provide users with the ability to create, edit and manage documents. In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a document-based app in Swift using the Document-based app template provided by Xcode.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following:
- Xcode installed on your Mac.
- Basic knowledge of Swift programming language.

## Step 1: Creating a New Project
1. Open Xcode and click on "Create a new Xcode project".
2. Select the "Document App" template under the iOS tab.
3. Provide a name for your project and choose a location to save it.
4. Click "Next" and configure project options such as organization name and language.
5. Optionally, check the "Use Core Data" checkbox if you want to include Core Data support in your app.
6. Click "Next" and choose a location to save your project.

## Step 2: Understanding the Project Structure
The generated project will have some predefined files and directories:
- `Document.xcdatamodel`: If you opted for Core Data support, this will contain the data model for your app.
- `DocumentBrowserViewController.swift`: This is the main view controller responsible for managing document browsing and creation.
- `DocumentViewController.swift`: This is the view controller for editing and displaying document content.
- `DocumentBrowser.storyboard`: The storyboard file for the document browser interface.
- `Main.storyboard`: The main storyboard file for the document view controller.

## Step 3: Configuring the Document Types
1. Open `DocumentBrowser.storyboard`.
2. Right-click on the blank area and select "Create New Document Type".
3. Configure the document type by setting the display name, identifier, supported file types, and icons.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to add more document types if needed.

## Step 4: Implementing Document Handling
1. Open `Document.swift`.
2. Customize the `contents(forType:)` and `load(fromContents:ofType:)` methods to handle loading and saving of document contents.
3. Optionally, override other methods like `fileWrapper(ofType:)`, `read(from:, ofType:)`, and `write(to:, ofType:)` based on your app's requirements.

## Step 5: Implementing Document View Controller
1. Open `DocumentViewController.swift`.
2. Customize the view controller to display and edit the loaded document.
3. Update the UI and add necessary functionality to suit your app's needs.

## Step 6: Testing the App
1. Choose a simulator as a build target and click on the "Run" button.
2. The app will launch in the simulator, and you can now create, edit and manage documents.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to create a document-based app in Swift using Xcode's Document-based app template. We explored the project structure, configured document types, implemented document handling, and created a custom document view controller. Now you can build your own document-based app with ease!
