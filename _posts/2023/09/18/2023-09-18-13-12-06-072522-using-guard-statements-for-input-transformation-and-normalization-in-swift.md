In Swift, guard statements are a powerful tool for input validation and handling optional values. They allow you to gracefully handle unexpected or invalid input conditions, and ensure that the data you are working with is in the expected format.

In addition to input validation, guard statements can also be used for input transformation and normalization. This means that you can take an input value, check if it is valid, and if so, transform it into the desired format.

Let's take a look at an example use case of using guard statements for input transformation and normalization.

```swift
struct User {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
}

func createUser(name: String?, ageString: String?) -> User? {
    guard let name = name, !name.isEmpty else {
        // Invalid or missing name
        return nil
    }
    
    guard let ageString = ageString, let age = Int(ageString), age >= 18 else {
        // Invalid or missing age
        return nil
    }
    
    return User(name: name, age: age)
}

let user = createUser(name: "John Doe", ageString: "25")
if let user = user {
    print("User created: \(user.name) (\(user.age) years old)")
} else {
    print("Invalid input")
}
```

In the above example, we have a `User` struct with a `name` and `age` property. The `createUser` function takes in two optional parameters: `name` and `ageString`. 

We use guard statements to validate and transform the input parameters. The first guard statement checks if the `name` is not nil and not empty. If it fails, we return nil indicating invalid or missing name.

The second guard statement checks if the `ageString` is not nil, can be converted into an integer, and the resulting age is greater than or equal to 18. If any condition fails, we return nil indicating invalid or missing age.

If both guard statements pass, we create a new `User` object and return it.

In the main code block, we call the `createUser` function with valid input parameters and print the user details. If the input is invalid, we print "Invalid input".

Guard statements provide a clean and concise way to handle input transformation and normalization. By using guard statements, you can ensure that the input data is valid and in the desired format, making your code more robust and less prone to errors.
