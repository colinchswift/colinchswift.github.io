With the increasing demand for data visualization in mobile applications, building a document viewer that includes interactive charts and graphs has become essential. In this blog post, we will explore how to accomplish this using Swift, one of the most popular programming languages for iOS development.

## Setting up the Project
Before diving into the implementation details, let's first set up our Swift project. Open Xcode and create a new iOS project. Choose the Swift language and give your project a suitable name.

## Integrating a Charting Library
To add interactive charts and graphs to our document viewer, we will use a charting library called Charts. Charts is a powerful open-source library that provides a wide range of chart types, including line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and more.

To integrate Charts into our project, we will use CocoaPods, a dependency manager for iOS projects. Create a `Podfile` in your project's directory and add the following lines:

```
platform :ios, '12.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Project Name>' do
    pod 'Charts'
end
```

Save the `Podfile` and run `pod install` in the terminal. This will install the Charts library and create a `.xcworkspace` file for your project. From now on, work with the `.xcworkspace` file instead of the `.xcodeproj` file.

## Creating a Document Viewer
With our project set up and the Charts library integrated, let's create a document viewer that will display our charts and graphs. In your project, create a new Swift file called `DocumentViewerViewController` and make it a subclass of `UIViewController`.

```swift
import UIKit
import Charts

class DocumentViewerViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        // Initialize and configure your charts here
    }
}
```

Within the `viewDidLoad` method, you can initialize and configure any type of chart you want to display. For example, let's create a line chart and add it to the view:

```swift
let chartView = LineChartView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: view.frame.width, height: view.frame.height))
view.addSubview(chartView)

// Customize the chart properties here

let entries = [ChartDataEntry(x: 0, y: 10), ChartDataEntry(x: 1, y: 20), ChartDataEntry(x: 2, y: 15)]
let dataSet = LineChartDataSet(entries: entries, label: "Data")
chartView.data = LineChartData(dataSet: dataSet)
```

Feel free to explore other chart types and customize the appearance according to your needs.

## Building an Interactive Document Viewer
To make our document viewer interactive, we can add gestures or controls to allow the user to interact with the charts. For example, we can add a UISegmentedControl to switch between different types of charts:

```swift
let segmentedControl = UISegmentedControl(items: ["Line", "Bar", "Pie"])
segmentedControl.frame = CGRect(x: 20, y: view.frame.height - 50, width: view.frame.width - 40, height: 30)
segmentedControl.addTarget(self, action: #selector(segmentedControlValueChanged), for: .valueChanged)
view.addSubview(segmentedControl)
```

In the `segmentedControlValueChanged` method, we can update the chart based on the selected segment:

```swift
@objc func segmentedControlValueChanged(sender: UISegmentedControl) {
    // Update the chart based on the selected segment
}
```

You can add more interactivity, such as pinch or swipe gestures to zoom or scroll through the charts.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have explored how to build a document viewer with interactive charts and graphs using Swift. We integrated the Charts library and created a basic implementation of a document viewer that displays a line chart. By adding interactivity through gestures or controls, we can enhance the user experience and allow them to explore and analyze data visually.

Remember to experiment with different chart types, customize their appearance, and add more interactive features to suit your specific requirements.
