In today's digital age, it's essential to efficiently handle large amounts of data and optimize storage space. Document archiving and compression features play a crucial role in achieving this goal. In this article, we will explore how to implement these features using Swift, Apple's programming language for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

## Document Archiving

Document archiving refers to the process of storing and organizing files in a structured manner for easy retrieval and management. Swift offers several options for implementing document archiving in your applications.

### NSKeyedArchiver and NSKeyedUnarchiver

One straightforward approach is to use the `NSKeyedArchiver` and `NSKeyedUnarchiver` classes provided by Foundation framework. These classes allow you to encode and decode objects into a byte stream that can be written to disk.

To archive an object, you can use the following code:

```swift
let obj = MyCustomObject()
let data = NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: obj)
```

And to unarchive it later:

```swift
let unarchivedObj = NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveObject(with: data)
```

Make sure your custom object conforms to the `NSCoding` protocol to enable encoding and decoding operations. This protocol requires implementing the `encode(with:)` and `init(coder:)` methods.

### Codable Protocol

Swift 4 introduced the `Codable` protocol, which simplifies the process of archiving and unarchiving objects. By conforming to the `Codable` protocol, your custom classes and structs can be automatically encoded and decoded.

To archive and unarchive an object using `Codable`, you can use the following code:

```swift
let obj = MyCustomObject()
let encoder = JSONEncoder()
let data = try encoder.encode(obj)
```

```swift
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
let unarchivedObj = try decoder.decode(MyCustomObject.self, from: data)
```

The `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` classes serialize and deserialize data in JSON format. You can also use `PropertyListEncoder` and `PropertyListDecoder` for property list serialization.

## Compression

Compression enables you to reduce the size of files and optimize storage space. Swift provides built-in compression options for compressing and decompressing data.

### Compression APIs
Swift's `Compression` module offers functions for data compression using various algorithms such as zlib and LZFSE.

Here is an example of compressing and decompressing data using the `zlib` algorithm:

```swift
let originalData = Data("This is some data to compress".utf8)

// Compression
if let compressedData = originalData.compress(withAlgorithm: .zlib) {
    // Store or transmit the compressed data
}

// Decompression
if let decompressedData = compressedData.decompress(withAlgorithm: .zlib) {
    // Use the decompressed data
}
```

You can choose different compression algorithms provided by the compression module, like `.lzfse`, `.lz4`, or `.lzma`.

### FileManager

Swift's `FileManager` class also offers compression and decompression capabilities using the `zipArchive` method. You first need to import the `ZipArchive` framework to use this feature.

Here is an example of how to use `zipArchive` for compressing and decompressing a folder:

```swift
import ZipArchive

func compressFolder(atPath path: String, toDestination destination: String) {
    SSZipArchive.createZipFile(atPath: destination, withContentsOfDirectory: path)
}

func decompressFile(atPath path: String, toDestination destination: String) {
    SSZipArchive.unzipFile(atPath: path, toDestination: destination)
}
```

The `SSZipArchive` library provides an easy-to-use interface for zipping and unzipping files and directories.

## Conclusion

Implementing document archiving and compression features in Swift can greatly enhance the efficiency of your applications. The NSKeyedArchiver and NSKeyedUnarchiver classes and the Codable protocol are excellent options for archiving and unarchiving objects. The Compression module and FileManager class provide convenient ways to compress and decompress data. Utilizing these features will help you optimize storage space and improve the performance of your apps.
