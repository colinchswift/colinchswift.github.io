Multithreading is a powerful technique that allows programs to perform multiple tasks concurrently, resulting in improved performance and responsiveness. However, multithreading introduces the challenge of avoiding data races, where multiple threads access and modify shared data simultaneously, leading to unpredictable and incorrect program behavior.

One common approach to address this challenge is to use locks to synchronize access to shared data. In Swift, locks can be implemented using the `os_unfair_lock` provided by the Objective-C runtime. However, the `os_unfair_lock` is a coarse-grained lock, meaning that it locks the entire critical section, even if only a small portion of it is being accessed by a particular thread.

To achieve better performance and reduce contention, we can use **fine-grained locking**. Fine-grained locking involves dividing the critical section into multiple smaller sections and applying locks only to the relevant sections that need to be accessed by threads.

Let's take a look at an example where we have an array that multiple threads can access and modify concurrently:

```swift
import Foundation

let lock = NSLock()
var sharedArray = [Int]() // shared array

func updateArray(index: Int, value: Int) {
    lock.lock()
    sharedArray[index] = value
    lock.unlock()
}

DispatchQueue.concurrentPerform(iterations: sharedArray.count) { index in
    updateArray(index: index, value: index)
}

print(sharedArray)
```

In this example, we use an `NSLock` to synchronize access to the shared array. The `updateArray` function is responsible for updating a specific element at the given index. The `lock` is acquired before modifying the array and released afterward to allow other threads to access it.

The `DispatchQueue.concurrentPerform` function is a convenient way to perform a loop in parallel. It assigns iterations of the loop to different threads, allowing for concurrent execution. In our example, each iteration of the loop calls the `updateArray` function with a different index.

By using fine-grained locking, we can improve performance and reduce contention in scenarios where multiple threads access different portions of shared data. However, it's important to note that using locks introduces the risk of deadlocks and should be used judiciously. It's also worth exploring other synchronization techniques, such as using concurrent data structures or adopting lock-free algorithms, depending on the specific requirements of your application.

Remember to always analyze the performance impact and behavior of your multithreaded code, and consider using profiling tools to identify potential bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
