In Swift, guard statements are used to ensure that certain conditions are met before proceeding with the execution of code. They provide a way to handle errors and validate input without the need for nested if-else constructs.

To prevent HTTP response splitting attacks, you should pay close attention to the values you send in the response headers. Here's an example of how guard statements can be used to safeguard against such attacks in Swift:

```swift
func sendHTTPResponse(_ response: HTTPURLResponse) {
    guard let headers = response.allHeaderFields as? [String: String] else {
        print("Invalid response headers format.")
        return
    }
    
    for (key, value) in headers {
        guard !key.contains("\r\n") && !value.contains("\r\n") else {
            print("Invalid characters in response headers.")
            return
        }
    }
    
    // Code to send the HTTP response...
}
```

In the above code snippet, the `sendHTTPResponse` function takes an `HTTPURLResponse` as a parameter and checks if the headers are in the expected format using a guard statement. If the headers are not in the expected format, it prints an error message and returns early.

Next, using a for-in loop, the function iterates over each header key-value pair and checks if any of the keys or values contain the newline characters (\r\n). If any invalid characters are found, it again prints an error message and returns early, effectively preventing the HTTP response splitting attack.

By using guard statements in this manner, you can ensure that the response headers are not vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks. Remember to apply similar checks for other parts of your code where HTTP headers are handled.
