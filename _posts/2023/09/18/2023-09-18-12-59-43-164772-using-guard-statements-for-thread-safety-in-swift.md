In multi-threaded programming, thread safety is crucial to prevent data races and ensure the correctness of your code. One way to achieve thread safety in Swift is by using guard statements. Guard statements allow you to exit early from a block of code if certain conditions are not met, making them well-suited for enforcing thread safety.

## What is a Guard Statement?

A guard statement is an early exit control flow statement introduced in Swift. It provides a way to check conditions and require a certain condition to be true in order to continue executing the rest of the code block. If the condition is not met, the guard statement is used to exit the block of code, either by returning, throwing an error, or using other control flow statements.

## Ensuring Thread Safety with Guard Statements

Guard statements can be used to create a safe execution path when dealing with shared resources in a multi-threaded environment. Here's an example of how you can use guard statements to implement thread safety in Swift:

```swift
class MyThreadSafeClass {
    private var sharedResource: String = ""

    private let accessQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.example.threadSafeAccess")

    func updateResource(newValue: String) {
        accessQueue.async {
            // Ensure thread safety with guard statement
            guard Thread.current.isMainThread else {
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    self.updateResource(newValue: newValue)
                }
                return
            }

            // Perform update operation safely on the shared resource
            self.sharedResource = newValue
        }
    }

    func getResource() -> String {
        var resourceValue: String = ""
        accessQueue.sync {
            // Ensure thread safety with guard statement
            guard Thread.current.isMainThread else {
                DispatchQueue.main.sync {
                    resourceValue = self.getResource()
                }
                return
            }

            // Return the current value of the shared resource
            resourceValue = self.sharedResource
        }
        return resourceValue
    }
}
```

In the above example, we have a `MyThreadSafeClass` that maintains a shared string resource. The `updateResource` method is used to update the shared resource, while the `getResource` method is used to fetch the current value of the shared resource.

To ensure thread safety, we utilize a private serial dispatch queue `accessQueue` to synchronize access to the shared resource. Inside the queue block, we use a guard statement to check if the current thread is the main thread. If it's not, we perform the respective operation on the main thread asynchronously or synchronously, depending on the context.

## Conclusion

Thread safety is crucial in multi-threaded programming to avoid data races and ensure the correctness of your code. Guard statements can be a powerful tool to enforce thread safety by providing a safe execution path when dealing with shared resources. By using guard statements in Swift, you can ensure that code is executed safely and correctly, even in complex multi-threaded scenarios.
