Swift is a strongly typed language that enforces type safety throughout the codebase. One common task in Swift is type checking, which ensures that variables or constants have the expected types before performing operations on them.

One way to perform type checking is by using `guard` statements in Swift. The `guard` statement allows you to check a condition and exit early if it's not met, reducing the need for nested `if-else` statements and making your code more readable.

Let's take a look at an example to understand how to use `guard` statements for type checking:

```swift
func process(value: Any) {
    guard let intValue = value as? Int else {
        print("Value is not of type Int")
        return
    }

    // If the value is an Int, we can safely use it
    print("Processing the value: \(intValue)")
}
```

In the above code, we have a function called `process` that takes in a parameter `value` of type `Any`. The goal is to ensure that the `value` is an `Int` before proceeding with further operations.

Using the `guard` statement, we attempt to cast `value` to an `Int` using the `as?` operator. If the cast is successful, the constant `intValue` will hold the value. If the cast fails, the `else` block will be executed, printing a helpful message and returning early from the function.

By using `guard` statements, we improve code readability and reduce the risk of handling incorrect types, especially when dealing with complex code blocks where multiple type checks are required.

Remember, `guard` statements can also be used with other types, such as checking for the presence of optional values or verifying that an array has a certain number of elements.

Now that you understand how to use `guard` statements for type checking in Swift, you can leverage this powerful feature to write cleaner and safer code.
