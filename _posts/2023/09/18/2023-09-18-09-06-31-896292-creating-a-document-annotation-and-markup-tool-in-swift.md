With the increasing digitization of documents, there is a growing need for tools that allow users to annotate and markup digital documents effectively. In this blog post, we will explore how to create a document annotation and markup tool using Swift programming language.

## Setting Up the Project

To get started, let's create a new Swift project in Xcode. Open Xcode and select "Create a new Xcode project." Choose "App" as the project template and select "Swift" as the language. Provide a name for your project and choose a location to save it.

## Designing the User Interface

The first step in creating our document annotation and markup tool is to design the user interface (UI). We can use SwiftUI to create a simple and elegant UI for our tool.

Open the `ContentView.swift` file and replace the default code with the following:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            VStack {
                Text("Document Annotation and Markup Tool")
                    .font(.largeTitle)
                
                Spacer()
                
                Image("document")
                    .resizable()
                    .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
                    .padding()
                
                Spacer()
                
                NavigationLink(destination: AnnotationView()) {
                    Text("Start Annotating")
                        .font(.headline)
                        .padding()
                        .background(Color.blue)
                        .foregroundColor(.white)
                        .cornerRadius(10)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This code defines the main view of our app, which displays a title, an image of a document, and a button to start annotating the document.

## Implementing the Annotation View

Next, let's create the `AnnotationView.swift` file and implement the annotation view, where users can add annotations and markup to the document.

```swift
struct AnnotationView: View {
    @State private var annotationText = ""
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextEditor(text: $annotationText)
                .frame(height: 200)
                .border(Color.gray, width: 1)
                .padding()
            
            Button(action: {
                // Save the annotation and update the document
                saveAnnotation()
            }) {
                Text("Save Annotation")
                    .font(.headline)
                    .padding()
                    .background(Color.green)
                    .foregroundColor(.white)
                    .cornerRadius(10)
            }
        }
        .padding()
    }
    
    func saveAnnotation() {
        // Implement your logic here to save the annotation and update the document
    }
}
```

This code defines the annotation view, which includes a TextEditor for users to enter their annotations and a button to save the annotation. When the button is tapped, it will call the `saveAnnotation()` function, where you can implement your custom logic to save the annotation and update the document.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have explored how to create a document annotation and markup tool using Swift. We designed a simple UI using SwiftUI and implemented the annotation view where users can add annotations and markup to the document.

By building upon this foundation, you can further enhance the tool by adding features such as highlighting, underlining, and drawing on the document.
