In this blog post, we will explore how to integrate handwriting and sketch recognition into Swift document-based apps. With the advancement of technology, handwriting and sketch recognition have become increasingly popular for various applications, including note-taking, drawing apps, and digital document management. By incorporating this functionality into your own Swift document-based app, you can enhance the user experience and provide powerful features to your users.

## Prerequisites
Before diving into the implementation, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of Swift programming language
- Familiarity with Xcode IDE
- Understanding of document-based app architecture in Swift

## Step 1: Setting Up the Project
- Open Xcode and create a new document-based app project.
- Configure the project settings, such as app name, bundle identifier, and team.
- Specify the document type(s) your app will support, e.g., PDF, JPEG, etc.

## Step 2: Integrating Handwriting Recognition
To integrate handwriting recognition into your Swift document-based app, you can leverage existing libraries or frameworks. One popular library for handwriting recognition is the MLKit from Firebase.

1. Add MLKit to your project by following the official Firebase documentation.
2. Create a new MLKit service instance in your code:

```swift
import MLKit

let handwritingRecognition = TextRecognizer.textRecognizer()
```

3. Implement a method to process handwriting recognition on an image or document:

```swift
func recognizeHandwriting(image: UIImage, completion: @escaping (String?) -> Void) {
    let visionImage = VisionImage(image: image)

    handwritingRecognition.process(visionImage) { result, error in
        guard error == nil, let result = result else {
            completion(nil)
            return
        }

        let recognizedText = result.text
        completion(recognizedText)
    }
}
```

4. Invoke the handwriting recognition method with an image or document in your app:

```swift
let image = UIImage(named: "handwritten_note")
recognizeHandwriting(image: image) { recognizedText in
    if let text = recognizedText {
        // Display or process the recognized text
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Adding Sketch Recognition
Integrating sketch recognition into your Swift document-based app allows users to draw or sketch on the documents and convert them into digital representations. One popular library for sketch recognition is the Vision framework from Apple.

1. Import the Vision framework into your code:

```swift
import Vision
```

2. Create a method to process sketch recognition on a drawn image:

```swift
func recognizeSketch(image: UIImage, completion: @escaping ([VNClassificationObservation]?) -> Void) {
    guard let ciImage = CIImage(image: image) else {
        completion(nil)
        return
    }

    let requestHandler = VNImageRequestHandler(ciImage: ciImage, options: [:])
    let request = VNClassifyImageRequest()

    try? requestHandler.perform([request])

    completion(request.results as? [VNClassificationObservation])
}
```

3. Utilize the sketch recognition method in your app:

```swift
let sketchImage = UIImage(named: "sketch")
recognizeSketch(image: sketchImage) { results in
    if let classifications = results {
        // Process the recognized sketch classifications
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
By adding handwriting and sketch recognition to your Swift document-based app, you can enhance the user experience and provide powerful text and sketch analysis capabilities. Leveraging libraries like MLKit and Vision allows for seamless integration of these features into your app. Incorporate handwritten notes and digital sketches effortlessly into your document-based app to elevate its functionality and usability.
