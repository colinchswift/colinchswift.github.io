When it comes to processing user input or validating data in Swift, using guard statements can greatly improve code readability and maintainability. Guard statements provide a convenient way to validate conditions and exit early if the required criteria are not met.

Let's take a look at how we can use guard statements for input formatting and validation in Swift:

## Input Formatting

Guard statements can be used to ensure that the user input is in the desired format. For example, let's say we want the user to enter a valid email address. We can utilize a guard statement to check if the input matches the expected format using regular expressions:

```swift
func validateEmail(_ email: String) -> Bool {
    let emailRegex = "[A-Z0-9a-z._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Za-z]{2,}"
    guard let emailPredicate = NSPredicate(format: "SELF MATCHES %@", emailRegex) else {
        return false
    }
    
    return emailPredicate.evaluate(with: email)
}
```

In the above code, we define a `validateEmail` function that takes an email string as input. We then create an `emailRegex` pattern using regular expressions to match the desired email format.

Next, we use a guard statement to create an `emailPredicate` with the email regex, and if it fails to create the predicate, we exit early and return `false`. Finally, we evaluate the email using the predicate and return the result.

## Input Validation

Guard statements are also helpful for input validation, ensuring that certain conditions are met before proceeding with the execution. Let's say we have a function that performs some calculation but requires the input to be within a specific range:

```swift
func performCalculation(with value: Int) {
    guard value >= 0 && value <= 100 else {
        print("Value must be between 0 and 100")
        return
    }
    
    // Perform calculation using the valid input value
    // ...
    // ...
}
```

Here, the `performCalculation` function expects the `value` parameter to be between `0` and `100`. If the condition fails, the guard statement will print an error message and exit early from the function.

By incorporating guard statements into our code, we can ensure that the input formatting and validation requirements are met before proceeding with further execution. This improves the reliability and readability of our Swift code.
