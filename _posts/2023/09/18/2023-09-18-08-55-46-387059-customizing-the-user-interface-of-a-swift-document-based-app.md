When developing a **Swift document-based app**, it is crucial to provide users with a *customizable and intuitive user interface (UI)*. Customizing the UI not only enhances the user experience but also makes your app stand out from the competition. In this blog post, we will explore some techniques for customizing the UI of a Swift document-based app.

## 1. Theming the App

One way to customize the UI is by implementing a **theme** for your app. A theme defines the overall look and feel of the app, including colors, fonts, and layout. By allowing users to choose from different themes, you can provide them with a personalized experience.

To implement theming in your Swift document-based app, you can create a **`ThemeManager`** class that manages the current theme and provides convenience methods to access theme-related properties. This class can have properties for colors, fonts, and other UI elements, which can be set based on the selected theme. You can use a **UserDefaults** property to store the selected theme and update the app's UI accordingly.

```swift
class ThemeManager {
    static let shared = ThemeManager()
    
    enum Theme: String {
        case light, dark
    }
    
    var currentTheme: Theme {
        get {
            guard let themeName = UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: "selectedTheme") else {
                return .light
            }
            return Theme(rawValue: themeName) ?? .light
        }
        set {
            UserDefaults.standard.set(newValue.rawValue, forKey: "selectedTheme")
            // Update the app's UI with the new theme
            // ...
        }
    }
    
    var backgroundColor: UIColor {
        switch currentTheme {
        case .light:
            return .white
        case .dark:
            return .black
        }
    }
    
    // Define other theme-related properties here...
}
```

With the `ThemeManager` in place, you can now apply the chosen theme throughout your app. For example, you can set the background color of a view by calling `ThemeManager.shared.backgroundColor`:

```swift
view.backgroundColor = ThemeManager.shared.backgroundColor
```

## 2. Customizing Document View Controllers

When working with a document-based app, you can provide custom **view controllers** for different document types. These view controllers can contain additional UI elements or provide a unique layout specific to the document type.

To customize a document view controller, you can subclass the base **`NSDocumentController`** or **`UIDocumentBrowserViewController`** class and override its methods to add or modify UI elements. For example, you can add a toolbar with custom buttons for actions related to the document.

```swift
class CustomDocumentViewController: NSDocumentController {
    
    override func windowDidLoad() {
        // Create and customize the toolbar
        let toolbar = NSToolbar(identifier: NSToolbar.Identifier(rawValue: "CustomToolbar"))
        toolbar.delegate = self
        self.window?.toolbar = toolbar
    }
    
    // Override other methods to add or modify UI elements...
}
```

By customizing the document view controllers, you can create a tailored UI for each document type, enhancing the usability and user experience of your app.

## Conclusion

Customizing the user interface of a Swift document-based app is essential for providing users with a personalized experience. By implementing themes and customizing document view controllers, you can create an intuitive and visually appealing app. Remember to regularly update and improve your UI based on user feedback and evolving design trends.
