With the advancement in technology, optical mark recognition (OMR) has become a popular method for scanning and analyzing paper forms or documents. In this article, we will explore how to integrate OMR functionality into Swift-based document-based apps using a popular OMR library called "OMRKit". 

## What is OMRKit?

OMRKit is a powerful Swift framework that allows developers to integrate OMR capabilities seamlessly into their applications. It provides an easy-to-use API for detecting and analyzing marks on scanned documents. 

## Setting Up OMRKit

To begin, let's set up OMRKit in our Swift document-based app:

1. Start by creating a new Swift document-based application project in Xcode.
2. Add OMRKit as a dependency in your project. You can do this by adding the following line to your `Podfile`:

```swift
pod 'OMRKit'
```

3. Run `pod install` to install the OMRKit library.

## Scanning and Analyzing OMR Marks

Now that we have OMRKit integrated into our project, let's see how we can use it to scan and analyze OMR marks on scanned documents.

```swift
import OMRKit

// Load the scanned document image
let documentImage = UIImage(named: "scanned_document.png")

// Create an OMRScanner instance
let scanner = OMRScanner()

// Analyze the document image
scanner.analyzeImage(documentImage) { (results, error) in
    if let error = error {
        // Handle any errors during analysis
        print("OMR analysis failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    } else {
        // Process the OMR results
        if let results = results {
            for question in results.questions {
                if let chosenOption = question.chosenOption {
                    print("Question: \(question.questionNumber), Chosen Option: \(chosenOption)")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the above code snippet, we start by loading the scanned document image. We then create an instance of `OMRScanner` and call the `analyzeImage` method with the document image. The `results` variable in the completion block will contain the scanned document's OMR analysis results, which we can process accordingly.

## Conclusion

Integrating optical mark recognition (OMR) capabilities in Swift document-based apps has become simpler with the help of libraries like OMRKit. By following the steps and utilizing the sample code provided in this article, you can enhance your document-based app with OMR functionality.
