In Swift, it's important to handle error cases gracefully, especially when dealing with user input or external data. When working with URLs, one common scenario is ensuring that the provided URL scheme is valid and secure.

Fortunately, Swift provides the `guard` statement, which allows us to check conditions and exit early if they are not met. This can be particularly useful when validating URL schemes.

Let's take a look at an example of guarding against invalid URL schemes using `guard` statements:

```swift
func processURL(_ urlString: String) {
    guard let url = URL(string: urlString) else {
        // Invalid URL format
        print("Invalid URL: \(urlString)")
        return
    }
    
    guard let scheme = url.scheme else {
        // URL has no scheme
        print("URL has no scheme: \(urlString)")
        return
    }
    
    guard scheme == "https" || scheme == "http" else {
        // Invalid or insecure URL scheme
        print("Invalid or insecure scheme: \(scheme)")
        return
    }
    
    // URL scheme is valid, continue processing
    print("Processing URL: \(url.absoluteString)")
    // ... additional code
}
```

In the example above, the `processURL` function takes a string parameter representing a URL. We use a series of `guard` statements to validate the URL before further processing.

- The first `guard` statement attempts to create a `URL` instance from the input string. If the URL format is invalid, we print an error message and return from the function.
- The second `guard` statement checks if the URL has a scheme. If the scheme is missing, we print an error message and return.
- The third `guard` statement verifies that the URL scheme is either "https" or "http". If the scheme is neither of these, an error message is printed, and we exit the function.

If all the `guard` conditions pass, we can safely assume that the URL scheme is valid and proceed with further processing.

By using `guard` statements, we can keep our code clean and avoid nested `if` statements or multiple levels of indentation. This approach helps improve code readability and maintainability.

Remember to customize the error handling behavior based on your specific requirements, such as displaying a user-friendly error message or handling the errors in a different way.
