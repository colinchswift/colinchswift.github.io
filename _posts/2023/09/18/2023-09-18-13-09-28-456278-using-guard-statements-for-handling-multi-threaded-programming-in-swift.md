In Swift, multi-threaded programming can be quite complex and error-prone. One way to handle this complexity and provide better control flow is by using guard statements. Guard statements are powerful constructs that allow you to check for certain conditions early on in your code and exit the current scope if the conditions are not met. 

Here's how you can use guard statements to handle multi-threaded programming in Swift:

```swift
import Dispatch

// Create a serial queue for thread safety
let queue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.example.queue")

// Perform a task asynchronously on a background thread
queue.async {
    guard !Thread.isMainThread else {
        // Exit if executed on the main thread
        return
    }
    
    // Perform your thread-specific task here
    // ...
    
    // Use a guard statement to ensure thread safety
    guard Thread.isMainThread else {
        // Exit if executed on a different thread
        return
    }
    
    // Perform UI updates on the main thread
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        // ...
    }
}
```

In the above code, we create a serial queue (`DispatchQueue`) which ensures that only one task is executed at a time, guaranteeing thread safety. We then use the `async` method to perform a task asynchronously on a background thread.

The first guard statement checks if the task is executed on the main thread. If it is, we immediately exit the current scope, avoiding any potential issues related to modifying the UI on a background thread.

Next, we perform our thread-specific task, ensuring that it is executed on the background thread.

Then, we use another guard statement to ensure that the subsequent UI updates are performed on the main thread. This is important as UI updates should always be done on the main thread to avoid any visual glitches or crashes.

By using guard statements, we can catch potential issues early in our code and gracefully handle them, improving the overall stability and performance of our multi-threaded programs.
