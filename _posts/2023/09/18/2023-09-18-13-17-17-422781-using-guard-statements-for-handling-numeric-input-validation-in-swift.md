When building applications, it is important to validate user input to ensure that it meets certain criteria and prevent issues down the line. One common scenario is validating numeric input like user age or quantity.

In Swift, guard statements provide a concise and readable way to handle input validation. They allow you to check if a condition is met and exit early if it is not, ensuring that you have valid input before proceeding with further code execution.

Let's take a look at an example of using guard statements for numeric input validation in Swift:

```swift
func validateAge(age: Int) -> Bool {
    guard age >= 18 else {
        print("Age must be 18 or older.")
        return false
    }
    
    guard age <= 100 else {
        print("Age must be 100 or younger.")
        return false
    }
    
    return true
}

let userAge = 25

if validateAge(age: userAge) {
    print("Age is valid.")
    // Proceed with further code execution
} else {
    print("Invalid age.")
    // Handle invalid input
}
```

In the code above, we define a `validateAge` function that takes an integer parameter `age`. We use guard statements to validate the input against our criteria:

- The first guard statement checks if `age` is greater than or equal to 18. If it is not, we print an error message and return `false`.
- The second guard statement checks if `age` is less than or equal to 100. If it is not, we print another error message and return `false`.

If both guard statements pass, indicating that the input is valid, we return `true`. We can then use this function to validate the user's age and proceed with further code execution accordingly.

Using guard statements for numeric input validation provides several benefits:
- **Readability**: Guard statements make the code more readable and self-explanatory, as the condition and action to be taken are clearly stated.
- **Early exit**: The use of guard statements allows for early exit from the function if the validation conditions are not met, reducing the nesting of code and improving overall code structure.
- **Error handling**: By providing specific error messages for validation failures, we can communicate clear feedback to the user about what went wrong with their input.

By employing guard statements for numeric input validation in Swift, you can ensure that your application handles user input gracefully and minimizes the risk of encountering unexpected issues.
