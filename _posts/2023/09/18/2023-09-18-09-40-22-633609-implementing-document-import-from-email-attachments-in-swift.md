In this tutorial, we will learn how to import a document from email attachments in Swift. This can be useful for applications that handle file management or document processing. We will use the `MessageUI` framework to access email attachments and extract the document from them.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you should have the following:

- Basic knowledge of Swift programming language
- Xcode installed on your development machine
- A working email account configured on your iPhone or iPad

## Step 1: Set Up the Project

1. Open Xcode and create a new project by selecting "Single View App" under the "iOS" tab.

2. Enter a product name for your app and choose a team for signing.

3. Choose a location to save the project and click "Create".

## Step 2: Importing Document from Email

1. Import the `MessageUI` framework by adding the following import statement at the top of your Swift file:

```swift
import MessageUI
```

2. Add the `MFMailComposeViewControllerDelegate` protocol to your class declaration:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, MFMailComposeViewControllerDelegate {
    // Your code here
}
```

3. Implement a function that will handle importing the document from email attachments:

```swift
func importDocument(from attachment: MFMailComposeAttachment) {
    if let data = attachment.content {
        let documentURL = FileManager.default.temporaryDirectory.appendingPathComponent(attachment.filename)
        
        do {
            try data.write(to: documentURL)
            // Process the document or save it to your app's document directory
        } catch {
            print("Error writing document: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    }
}
```

4. In your view controller, add a button to trigger the document import action:

```swift
@IBAction func importDocumentButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
    let mailComposeVC = MFMailComposeViewController()
    mailComposeVC.mailComposeDelegate = self
    present(mailComposeVC, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

5. Implement the `MFMailComposeViewControllerDelegate` methods to handle the email composition view controller and extract attachments:

```swift
extension ViewController {
    
    func mailComposeController(_ controller: MFMailComposeViewController, didFinishWith result: MFMailComposeResult, error: Error?) {
        /* Handle the result here */
        dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
    
    func mailComposeController(_ controller: MFMailComposeViewController, didFinishWith result: MFMailComposeResult) {
        if let attachments = controller.addedAttachments {
            for attachment in attachments {
                importDocument(from: attachment)
            }
        }
        
        dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Test the Document Import

1. Run your project on a device or simulator.

2. Tap on the "Import Document" button to trigger the email composition view controller.

3. Compose a new email or choose an existing email with attachments.

4. Tap on the send button to close the email composer.

5. The `importDocument(from:)` function will be called, and the document will be imported and saved in the temporary directory. You can process the document or save it to your app's document directory as per your requirement.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to import a document from email attachments in Swift using the `MessageUI` framework. This functionality can be extended to handle various file types and improve document management in your iOS applications.
