In today's fast-paced and interconnected world, collaboration is key. Whether you're working on a project with a team or simply collaborating with others on a document, having real-time collaboration features is becoming increasingly important. In this blog post, we will explore how to add collaboration features to a document-based app using Swift.

## Why Collaborative Editing?

Collaborative editing allows multiple users to simultaneously edit the same document, making it easier to work together and reducing the need for constant back-and-forth communication. It provides a seamless and efficient way to collaborate, saving time and improving productivity.

## Setting Up the Project

To get started, we first need to set up our Swift document-based app project. Open Xcode and create a new project using the "Document-Based App" template. This template provides a pre-configured setup for document-based apps, which is suitable for adding collaboration features.

## Integrating Real-Time Collaboration

Now that we have our project set up, let's integrate real-time collaboration using a cloud-based service. For this example, we will use **Firebase Realtime Database**.

1. Set up Firebase in your project by following the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup).
2. Create a new document model class that conforms to `Codable` protocol. This class will represent the structure of the collaborative document.

```swift
class CollaborativeDocument: Codable {
    var title: String
    var content: String
    
    init(title: String, content: String) {
        self.title = title
        self.content = content
    }
}
```

3. In your document view controller, add Firebase Realtime Database initialization code inside `viewDidLoad`.

```swift
import Firebase

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    
    FirebaseApp.configure()
}
```

4. Implement the document saving and loading methods to synchronize the document with the database.

```swift
import FirebaseDatabase

override func save(to url: URL, for saveOperation: UIDocument.SaveOperation, completionHandler: ((Bool) -> Void)? = nil) {
    super.save(to: url, for: saveOperation, completionHandler: completionHandler)
    
    let documentData = CollaborativeDocument(title: self.documentTitle, content: self.documentContent).toJSONData()
    Database.database().reference().child("documents").child(url.lastPathComponent).setValue(documentData)
}

override func load(fromContents contents: Any, ofType typeName: String?) throws {
    super.load(fromContents: contents, ofType: typeName)
    
    guard let documentData = contents as? Data else { return }
    
    let document = try JSONDecoder().decode(CollaborativeDocument.self, from: documentData)
    self.documentTitle = document.title
    self.documentContent = document.content
}
```

## Implementing Real-Time Sync

Now that our app can load and save documents to the database, let's implement real-time synchronization so that changes made by one user are instantly reflected on other devices.

1. Add an observer to the database reference that listens for changes to the document data.

```swift
Database.database().reference().child("documents").child(url.lastPathComponent).observe(.value) { snapshot in
    guard let documentData = snapshot.value as? Data else { return }
    
    let document = try? JSONDecoder().decode(CollaborativeDocument.self, from: documentData)
    self.documentTitle = document?.title ?? ""
    self.documentContent = document?.content ?? ""
}
```

2. Update the document data in the database whenever it changes.

```swift
func textViewDidChange(_ textView: UITextView) {
    let documentData = CollaborativeDocument(title: self.documentTitle, content: self.documentContent).toJSONData()
    Database.database().reference().child("documents").child(url.lastPathComponent).setValue(documentData)
}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to add collaboration features to a Swift document-based app using Firebase Realtime Database. With real-time synchronization and collaborative editing, users can work together seamlessly on the same document. This not only improves productivity but also enhances the overall collaboration experience. By integrating these features into your document-based app, you can take your app to the next level and provide a rich collaborative environment for your users.
