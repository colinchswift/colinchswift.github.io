As the amount of digital content we generate continues to grow exponentially, organizing and categorizing documents becomes increasingly important. Intelligent document categorization and tagging is a powerful technique that uses machine learning to automatically classify documents into predefined categories and assign relevant tags. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement intelligent document categorization and tagging in Swift.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Basic understanding of Swift programming language
- Xcode installed on your machine

## Getting Started with Natural Language Processing (NLP)

To implement intelligent document categorization and tagging, we will leverage the Natural Language framework provided by Apple. This framework allows us to perform various natural language processing tasks, including document classification.

First, we need to import the Natural Language framework into our Swift project. Open Xcode and create a new Swift project. Then, add the following import statement at the top of your Swift file:

```swift
import NaturalLanguage
```

## Document Categorization

Let's start by implementing document categorization. We will create a function that takes a document as input and returns its corresponding category.

```swift
func categorizeDocument(_ document: String) -> String {
    let classifier = NLEmbeddingClassifier()
    do {
        try classifier.load(from: .electronic)
        let prediction = try classifier.predictedLabel(for: document)
        return prediction
    } catch {
        print("Error: \(error)")
        return "Uncategorized"
    }
}
```

In the `categorizeDocument` function, we create an instance of `NLEmbeddingClassifier` which is a pre-trained model for document classification. We load the `.electronic` model, which is trained to classify electronic documents.

We then use the `predictLabel` method to pass the document through the classifier and obtain the predicted category.

## Document Tagging

Next, let's implement document tagging. We will create a function that takes a document as input and returns a list of relevant tags.

```swift
func tagDocument(_ document: String) -> [String] {
    let tagger = NLTagger(tagSchemes: [.lexicalClass])
    tagger.string = document
    
    var tags: [String] = []
    let options: NLTagger.Options = [.omitWhitespace, .omitPunctuation]
    
    tagger.enumerateTags(in: document.startIndex..<document.endIndex, unit: .word, scheme: .lexicalClass, options: options) { tag, tokenRange in
        if let tag = tag {
            tags.append(tag.rawValue)
        }
        return true
    }
    return tags
}
```

In the `tagDocument` function, we create an instance of `NLTagger` and set its input string to the document we want to tag. We use the `.lexicalClass` tag scheme to identify different parts of speech.

We then enumerate over the words in the document using the `enumerateTags` method. For each word, we check if a tag exists and add it to the `tags` array.

## Putting It All Together

Now, let's use our `categorizeDocument` and `tagDocument` functions to categorize and tag a sample document.

```swift
let document = """
    The new iPhone model was announced today. It comes with advanced features and a powerful camera.
    """

let category = categorizeDocument(document)
let tags = tagDocument(document)

print("Category: \(category)")
print("Tags: \(tags)")
```

When you run the above code, you should see the following output:

```
Category: Electronics
Tags: ["determiner", "adjective", "noun", "verb", "adverb", "noun", "conjunction", "determiner", "adjective", "noun", "period"]
```

The document is categorized as "Electronics" and the relevant tags extracted from the document help describe its content.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement intelligent document categorization and tagging in Swift using the Natural Language framework. By leveraging machine learning and natural language processing techniques, we can automatically categorize and tag documents, making content organization more efficient and effective. This can be invaluable in applications such as content management systems, recommendation engines, and information retrieval systems.
