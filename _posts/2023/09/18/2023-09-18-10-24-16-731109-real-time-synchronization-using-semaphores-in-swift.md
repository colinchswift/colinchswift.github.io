Synchronization is a critical aspect of concurrent programming, especially when dealing with real-time systems. Semaphores are a popular synchronization primitive that can help in coordinating access to shared resources.

In Swift, we can leverage the `DispatchSemaphore` class to implement real-time synchronization using semaphores. The `DispatchSemaphore` class provides a way to regulate access to a resource by using a counting mechanism.

## How Semaphores Work

A semaphore maintains an internal counter that determines the number of threads that can access a shared resource simultaneously. When a thread wants to access the resource, it checks the counter value of the semaphore. If it is greater than zero, the thread is allowed to enter the critical section. If the counter is zero, the thread needs to wait until it becomes non-zero.

## Using Semaphores in Swift

Here's an example of how to use semaphores for real-time synchronization in Swift:

```swift
import Dispatch

let semaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 1)

// Thread 1
DispatchQueue.global().async {
    print("Thread 1 waiting")
    semaphore.wait()
    
    // Access the shared resource
    print("Thread 1 accessing the shared resource")
    
    // Do work
    
    // Release the semaphore
    semaphore.signal()
}

// Thread 2
DispatchQueue.global().async {
    print("Thread 2 waiting")
    semaphore.wait()
    
    // Access the shared resource
    print("Thread 2 accessing the shared resource")
    
    // Do work
    
    // Release the semaphore
    semaphore.signal()
}
```

In this example, we create a `DispatchSemaphore` object `semaphore` with an initial value of 1, indicating that one thread can access the shared resource at a time. The `wait()` method is used to decrement the semaphore counter, and the `signal()` method is used to increment it.

The example demonstrates two threads (Thread 1 and Thread 2) attempting to access the shared resource. If one of the threads is already accessing the resource, the other thread will wait until it can acquire the semaphore.

## Conclusion

Semaphores are a powerful synchronization primitive for managing access to shared resources in real-time systems. By using the `DispatchSemaphore` class in Swift, we can ensure that only a specified number of threads can access a resource simultaneously, preventing race conditions and resource contention.
