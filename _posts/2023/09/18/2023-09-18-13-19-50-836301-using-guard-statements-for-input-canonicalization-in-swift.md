Input canonicalization is the process of converting user input into a standardized format in order to ensure consistency and avoid potential issues. In Swift, guard statements can be used effectively to perform input canonicalization, providing a clean and concise way to handle input validation and transformation.

## What is a guard statement?

In Swift, a guard statement is used to impose requirements on the preliminary conditions of a function, method, or closure. It is designed to ensure that certain conditions are met in order to proceed with the execution of the code. 

A guard statement has a condition and an else clause. If the condition evaluates to false, the else clause is executed, and it typically includes an early return or a throw statement to exit the code and handle the failure case appropriately.

## Input canonicalization using guard statements

Here is an example of using guard statements for input canonicalization in Swift:

```swift
func validateAndCanonicalizeInput(_ input: String) -> String? {
    guard !input.isEmpty else {
        print("Input should not be empty!")
        return nil
    }
    
    var canonicalizedInput = input.lowercased()
    canonicalizedInput = canonicalizedInput.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
    
    guard canonicalizedInput.count >= 3 else {
        print("Input should have at least three characters!")
        return nil
    }
    
    return canonicalizedInput
}

// Usage
guard let canonicalizedInput = validateAndCanonicalizeInput("   Hello World   ") else {
    // Handle the failure case
    return
}

// Use the canonicalizedInput for further processing
print(canonicalizedInput) // Output: "hello world"
```

In the example above, the `validateAndCanonicalizeInput` function takes an input string and performs input canonicalization. It first checks if the input string is empty using the `guard !input.isEmpty` statement. If the condition evaluates to false, the else clause is executed and a message is printed before returning nil.

Next, the input string is converted to lowercase using the `lowercased()` method. Any leading or trailing whitespace and newline characters are then removed using the `trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)` method. Another guard statement is used to ensure that the canonicalized input has at least three characters.

If all the guard conditions pass, the function returns the canonicalized input string.

In the usage example, the `validateAndCanonicalizeInput` function is called with an input string. If the input passes all the guards, the canonicalized string is stored in `canonicalizedInput` and it can be used for further processing.

## Conclusion

Using guard statements for input canonicalization in Swift simplifies the process of validating and transforming user input. By leveraging guard conditions, you can ensure that the input meets the required criteria before proceeding with the rest of your code logic. This approach leads to more readable, maintainable, and robust code.
