In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a document reader in Swift using the text-to-speech functionality. This can be useful for applications that require text content to be read aloud to the user, such as ebooks, articles, or even audio-guided navigation.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure that you have the following:

1. Xcode installed on your machine.
2. Basic knowledge of Swift programming language.

## Step 1: Setup Project
1. Create a new iOS project in Xcode.
2. Choose the appropriate options for your project and save it.

## Step 2: Add AVFoundation Framework
1. Open the project navigator in Xcode.
2. Select the project file from the list of files.
3. Under the "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" section, click on the "+" button.
4. Search for "AVFoundation" and add it to your project.

## Step 3: Create User Interface
1. Open the Main.storyboard file in Interface Builder.
2. Drag and drop a UITextView onto the view controller's view.
3. Add a UIButton below the text view, labeled "Read".
4. Create an IBOutlet connection for the text view and button in your view controller class.

```swift
@IBOutlet weak var textView: UITextView!
@IBOutlet weak var readButton: UIButton!
```

## Step 4: Write Text-to-Speech Code
1. Open your view controller class and import AVFoundation.
2. Add the following AVSpeechSynthesizer delegate method to enable speech:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, AVSpeechSynthesizerDelegate {
   // ...
}
```

3. Create a speech synthesizer instance and configure it in your `viewDidLoad` method:

```swift
let synthesizer = AVSpeechSynthesizer()

override func viewDidLoad() {
   super.viewDidLoad()
   synthesizer.delegate = self
}
```

4. Implement the `readButtonTapped` method to start reading the text:

```swift
@IBAction func readButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
   let utterance = AVSpeechUtterance(attributedString: textView.attributedText)
   synthesizer.speak(utterance)
}
```

5. Add the following delegate method to handle completion:

```swift
func speechSynthesizer(_ synthesizer: AVSpeechSynthesizer, didFinish utterance: AVSpeechUtterance) {
   // Handle completion if needed
}
```

## Step 5: Test the Application
1. Build and run your application on a simulator or physical device.
2. Enter or paste text into the text view.
3. Tap the "Read" button to initiate text-to-speech.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully built a document reader with text-to-speech functionality in Swift using AVFoundation framework. You can now enhance this functionality by adding additional features like adjusting the speech rate, voice selection, or highlighting the currently spoken word.
