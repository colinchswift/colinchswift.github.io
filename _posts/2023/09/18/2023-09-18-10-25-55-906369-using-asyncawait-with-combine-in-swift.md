Swift 5.5 introduced the powerful `async/await` syntax, which allows developers to write asynchronous code in a more readable and sequential manner. The Combine framework also provides a convenient and expressive way to work with asynchronous streams using publishers and subscribers.

In this blog post, we will explore how to combine the power of `async/await` with Combine to handle asynchronous operations in a more streamlined way.

## Prerequisites

To follow along, make sure you are using Swift 5.5 or later and have the Combine framework available in your project.

## Basic Example

Let's start with a simple example of fetching data from a remote API using `async/await` with Combine. Suppose we have a function that fetches a user's profile from a server:

```swift
import Combine

func fetchUserProfile() async throws -> UserProfile {
    let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/profile")!
    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
    return try JSONDecoder().decode(UserProfile.self, from: data)
}
```

In the above code snippet, we define a function `fetchUserProfile()` that uses the `async` modifier to indicate that it is an asynchronous function. Inside the function, we use `await` to pause the execution until the data is successfully fetched from the API.

## Subscribing to the Publisher

To consume the asynchronous result of `fetchUserProfile()`, we can convert it into a `Future` publisher and subscribe to it:

```swift
fetchUserProfile()
    .subscribe(on: DispatchQueue.global())
    .sink { completion in
        // Handle completion
    } receiveValue: { userProfile in
        // Handle fetched user profile
    }
```

In the above code snippet, we use the `subscribe(on:)` operator to specify the queue on which the subscription should be performed. This ensures that the subscription happens on a background queue, preventing any UI freezing.

The `sink` operator allows us to handle both completion and the received value. In the completion closure, we can handle any error scenarios, while in the value closure, we can process the fetched user profile.

## Error Handling

To handle errors, we can use the do-catch mechanism with `try/catch`. For example, if we encounter an error while fetching the user profile, we can handle it as follows:

```swift
do {
    let userProfile = try await fetchUserProfile()
    // Handle fetched user profile
} catch {
    // Handle error
}
```

By wrapping the `await` statement inside a `do` block, any error thrown by the `fetchUserProfile()` function can be caught and handled in the `catch` block.

## Conclusion

The introduction of `async/await` in Swift 5.5, combined with the power of Combine, provides a more concise and readable way to work with asynchronous operations. By leveraging publishers and subscribers, we can easily integrate Combine with `async/await` to build more efficient and maintainable code.
