In this tutorial, we will explore how to create custom document export options in Swift. Document export options allow users to customize the format and settings when exporting a document, providing them with more flexibility and control over the exported content.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

1. Xcode installed on your machine.
2. Basic knowledge of Swift programming language.

## Step 1: Create Export Options View
First, we need to create a custom view where users can select their preferred export options. Create a new Swift file called `ExportOptionsView.swift`.

Example code:

```swift
import UIKit

class ExportOptionsView: UIView {

    // Add UI components such as labels, checkboxes, etc.
    // Provide options for file format, page range, orientation, etc.
    // Implement the necessary user interface logic.

}
```

## Step 2: Implement Export Options Handler
Next, we need to implement a handler that will take the selected export options and perform the necessary actions, such as exporting the document in the desired format. Create a new Swift file called `ExportOptionsHandler.swift`.

Example code:

```swift
import Foundation

class ExportOptionsHandler {

    func exportDocument(withOptions options: ExportOptions) {
        // Implement the logic to export the document using the provided options.
    }

}
```

## Step 3: Integrate Export Options View
Now, we need to integrate the `ExportOptionsView` into our existing view controller or wherever it is needed.

Example code:

```swift
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    // Add an IBAction for a button or any control that triggers the export options view.
    
    @IBAction func exportButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
        let exportOptionsView = ExportOptionsView(frame: view.bounds)
        // Customize the appearance of the export options view if needed.
        
        // Display the export options view to the user.
        // Implement the necessary logic to handle the selected options and call the export function.
    }
    
}
```

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can create custom document export options in Swift, empowering users to customize the format and settings when exporting a document. This provides a more personalized and flexible experience for your app's users.

Make sure to optimize the export functionality based on your app's specific requirements and provide clear instructions and feedback to the users during the export process.
