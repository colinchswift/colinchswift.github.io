In today's digital age, document viewing has become an essential part of many applications. Whether it's displaying PDF files, images, or other document formats, providing a seamless and user-friendly viewing experience is crucial. In this article, we will explore how to build a document viewer with advanced navigation features using Swift.

## Getting Started

Before we dive into the implementation details, let's outline the key features we want to include in our document viewer:

1. **Page navigation**: Users should be able to navigate between pages within the document.
2. **Zooming**: Users should be able to zoom in and out of the document for better readability.
3. **Rotation**: Users should have the option to rotate the document at different angles.

## Creating the Document Viewer

To get started, let's create a new Swift project in Xcode. We will use the `PDFKit` framework, which provides powerful tools for working with PDF documents. This framework also supports other document types, making it ideal for our document viewer.

First, let's import the necessary framework by adding the following line at the top of our file:

```swift
import PDFKit
```

Next, we'll create an instance of `PDFView`, which will be the main component of our document viewer:

```swift
let pdfView = PDFView()
```

We'll also set up the initial configuration for our viewer, including the document to be displayed and the frame of the view:

```swift
pdfView.autoScales = true
pdfView.displayMode = .singlePageContinuous
pdfView.document = PDFDocument(url: documentURL)
pdfView.frame = view.bounds
```

In the code above, `documentURL` represents the URL of the document to be opened. You can fetch this URL from a local file or download it from a remote resource.

## Implementing Navigation Features

Now that our document viewer is set up, let's implement the navigation features. We'll add buttons to navigate to the previous and next pages:

```swift
let previousPageButton = UIButton()
let nextPageButton = UIButton()

previousPageButton.setTitle("Previous", for: .normal)
nextPageButton.setTitle("Next", for: .normal)

previousPageButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(goToPreviousPage), for: .touchUpInside)
nextPageButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(goToNextPage), for: .touchUpInside)
```

We'll also define the actions for these buttons:

```swift
@objc func goToPreviousPage() {
    pdfView.goToPreviousPage(nil)
}

@objc func goToNextPage() {
    pdfView.goToNextPage(nil)
}
```

Additionally, let's add pinch gesture recognizers for zooming in and out:

```swift
let pinchGesture = UIPinchGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(handlePinch(_:)))
pdfView.addGestureRecognizer(pinchGesture)
```

Here's the implementation of the pinch gesture handler:

```swift
@objc func handlePinch(_ gestureRecognizer: UIPinchGestureRecognizer) {
    if gestureRecognizer.state == .changed {
        let currentScale = pdfView.scaleFactor
        let newScale = currentScale * gestureRecognizer.scale
        
        pdfView.scaleFactor = newScale
        gestureRecognizer.scale = 1
    }
}
```

Lastly, we can add a button for rotating the document:

```swift
let rotateButton = UIButton()

rotateButton.setTitle("Rotate", for: .normal)
rotateButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(rotateDocument), for: .touchUpInside)
```

And the corresponding action:

```swift
@objc func rotateDocument() {
    let currentRotation = pdfView.rotation
    let newRotation = currentRotation + 90
    
    pdfView.rotation = newRotation
}
```

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined in this article, you can build a document viewer with advanced navigation features using Swift. The `PDFKit` framework provides a solid foundation for working with various document formats, while the navigation features ensure a seamless user experience. Feel free to customize and enhance the viewer further based on your application's requirements.

Happy coding!
