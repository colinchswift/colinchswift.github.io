In this blog post, we will explore how to build a document ingestion and indexing system using the Swift programming language and Elasticsearch. This system will allow you to efficiently ingest and index large amounts of documents into Elasticsearch for quick and easy retrieval.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following software and tools installed:

- Swift programming language[^1]
- Elasticsearch[^2]

## Steps to Create the System

1. **Setting up Elasticsearch Cluster**

   Begin by setting up an Elasticsearch cluster or using an existing one. Ensure that the cluster is running and accessible.

2. **Install Elasticsearch Swift Client**

   Install the Elasticsearch Swift Client using the Swift Package Manager. You can do this by adding the package dependency to your `Package.swift` file:

   ```swift
   dependencies: [
       .package(url: "https://github.com/vapor-community/elasticsearch.git", from: "6.4.0")
   ]
   ```

3. **Configure Elasticsearch Connection**

   Connect to the Elasticsearch cluster by creating a connection configuration object. This will include the Elasticsearch host and port:

   ```swift
   let elasticsearchConfig = ElasticsearchClientConfig(
       host: "localhost",
       port: 9200
   )
   let elasticsearchClient = try ElasticsearchClient(config: elasticsearchConfig)
   ```

4. **Ingesting Documents**

   To ingest documents, convert them into JSON format and use the Elasticsearch client's `index` function:

   ```swift
   let document: [String: Any] = [
       "title": "Sample Document",
       "content": "This is a sample document."
   ]
   try elasticsearchClient.index(index: "documents", type: "_doc", id: "1", body: document)
   ```

5. **Searching for Documents**

   To search for documents, use the Elasticsearch client's `search` function:

   ```swift
   let searchQuery: [String: Any] = [
       "query": [
           "match": [
               "content": "sample"
           ]
       ]
   ]
   let searchResponse = try elasticsearchClient.search(index: "documents", body: searchQuery)
   let searchHits = searchResponse.hits.hits
   ```

   You can then iterate through the `searchHits` array to access the search results.

6. **Additional Features**

   Depending on your requirements, you can enhance your system with additional features such as filtering, sorting, and pagination. The Elasticsearch Swift client provides various methods and parameters to achieve this.

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can create a powerful document ingestion and indexing system using the Swift programming language and Elasticsearch. This system will allow you to ingest and index documents efficiently, making them easily searchable and retrievable.
