Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a common security vulnerability on the web. XSS attacks occur when an attacker injects malicious scripts into a web page, which are then executed by the users' browsers. This can lead to various security risks, such as stealing sensitive user information or performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

In Swift, guard statements are a powerful tool to help prevent XSS attacks by validating user input and protecting against code injection. Guard statements allow you to check conditions and exit early if they are not met, providing a robust defense against potential security vulnerabilities.

Here's an example of how you can use guard statements in Swift to protect against XSS attacks:

```swift
func processUserInput(input: String) {
    guard !input.contains("<script>") else {
        // The input contains a potential XSS attack
        print("Invalid input detected. Please try again.")
        return
    }

    // Process the user input
    // ...
    // Your logic here
}

let userInput = "<script>alert('XSS attack!');</script>"
processUserInput(input: userInput)
```

In this example, the `processUserInput` function takes a user input as a parameter. The guard statement checks if the input contains the `<script>` tag, which is commonly used in XSS attacks to inject malicious scripts. If the condition is `true`, the guard statement will execute the code inside the `else` block, printing a warning message and exiting the function. This prevents the user's input from being further processed.

By using the guard statement, you ensure that the user input is free from any potentially harmful scripts. This simple yet effective technique can significantly reduce the risk of XSS attacks in your Swift applications.

## Conclusion

Guard statements in Swift provide a convenient way to protect against XSS attacks by validating user input and preventing code injection. By using guard statements, you can effectively sanitize the user input and ensure the security of your application.
