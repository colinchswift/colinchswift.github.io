One of the key features of a document-based app in Swift is the ability to work with different file types. This allows users to open and save documents in various formats, such as text files, images, or even custom file types specific to your app.

In this blog post, we'll explore how to handle multiple document types in a Swift document-based app. We'll cover the steps involved in supporting different file formats and demonstrating how to handle these files in your app.

## Registering Document Types

To begin, you need to register the supported document types in your app's Info.plist file. This configuration tells the system which file types your app can handle.

```swift
<key>CFBundleDocumentTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleTypeName</key>
        <string>Text Document</string>
        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
        <string>Editor</string>
        <key>LSHandlerRank</key>
        <string>Owner</string>
        <key>LSItemContentTypes</key>
        <array>
            <string>public.plain-text</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleTypeName</key>
        <string>Image Document</string>
        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
        <string>Viewer</string>
        <key>LSHandlerRank</key>
        <string>Alternate</string>
        <key>LSItemContentTypes</key>
        <array>
            <string>public.image</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

In the above code snippet, we define two document types: "Text Document" and "Image Document". The `CFBundleTypeRole` specifies whether your app is an Editor or Viewer for the file type. The `LSItemContentTypes` contains the UTI (Uniform Type Identifier) for each file type.

## Opening Documents

When a user opens a document in your app, you need to handle the file appropriately based on its type. In your document class, override the `read(from:ofType:)` method to perform the necessary actions.

```swift
func read(from data: Data, ofType typeName: String) throws {
    if typeName == "public.plain-text" {
        // Handle text document
        let text = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)
        // Process the text data
    } else if typeName == "public.image" {
        // Handle image document
        let image = UIImage(data: data)
        // Process the image
    } else {
        throw NSError(domain: "com.yourapp.errors", code: 0, userInfo: nil)
    }
}
```

In the above code, we check the document type by comparing the `typeName` parameter with the supported UTIs. If it matches, we handle the document accordingly. If the document type is unsupported, we throw an error to indicate that the file cannot be opened.

## Saving Documents

Similar to opening documents, saving involves handling and converting the data based on the type. Override the `data(ofType:)` method in your document class to handle the saving process.

```swift
override func data(ofType typeName: String) throws -> Data {
    if typeName == "public.plain-text" {
        // Handle text document
        let textData = self.text.data(using: .utf8)
        return textData ?? Data()
    } else if typeName == "public.image" {
        // Handle image document
        let imageData = self.image.jpegData(compressionQuality: 1.0)
        return imageData ?? Data()
    } else {
        throw NSError(domain: "com.yourapp.errors", code: 0, userInfo: nil)
    }
}
```

In the above code, we check the document type and convert the data accordingly. For a text document, we encode the text using UTF-8 and return the data. For an image document, we convert the UIImage to JPEG data and return it. If the document type is unsupported, we throw an error.

## Conclusion

Handling multiple document types in a Swift document-based app allows users to work with various file formats. By registering the supported document types and implementing the necessary methods for opening and saving, you can provide a versatile user experience.

With the example code provided in this blog post, you should be able to start implementing multiple document type support in your own Swift document-based app. Embrace the flexibility and empower your users to work with their preferred file formats seamlessly.
