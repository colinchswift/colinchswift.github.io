When building command-line applications in Swift, it's crucial to validate user inputs to ensure the program runs smoothly and handles errors gracefully. One way to achieve this is by using guard statements for input validation.

## Why Use Guard Statements?

Guard statements provide a concise and readable way to check if certain conditions are met and exit early if they are not. They help simplify code and improve its readability by reducing nesting and eliminating the need for unnecessary `if-else` statements.

## Example Scenario

Let's assume we are building a command-line application that takes two inputs from the user: their name and their age. We want to ensure that the name is not empty and the age is a positive integer. Here's how we can use guard statements to validate the inputs:

```swift
import Foundation

// Get user inputs
func getUserInputs() -> (name: String, age: Int) {
    print("Please enter your name: ", terminator: "")
    guard let name = readLine(), !name.isEmpty else {
        print("Invalid name. Exiting...")
        exit(1)
    }

    print("Please enter your age: ", terminator: "")
    guard let ageString = readLine(), let age = Int(ageString), age > 0 else {
        print("Invalid age. Exiting...")
        exit(1)
    }

    return (name, age)
}

// Main program
func main() {
    let inputs = getUserInputs()
    let name = inputs.name
    let age = inputs.age
    
    // Use the validated inputs
    print("Hello, \(name)! You are \(age) years old.")
}

main()
```

## Explanation

In the example above, we define a `getUserInputs()` function that returns a tuple consisting of the validated name and age. 

Inside the function, we use guard statements to check if the `name` is not empty and if the `age` is a positive integer. If any of these conditions fail, we print an error message and exit the program using `exit(1)`.

Using guard statements allows us to maintain a flat code structure without excessive nesting. It also makes it clear what the expected conditions are for the inputs.

## Conclusion

By utilizing guard statements, we can simplify input validation in command-line applications, improving code readability and reducing nested conditions. This approach ensures that the program only proceeds if the necessary conditions are met, preventing unexpected errors. 

Start implementing guard statements in your Swift command-line applications to handle input validation effectively and provide a smoother user experience.
