In this tutorial, we will learn how to build a document search engine using Swift and Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch is a powerful open-source search and analytics engine that enables fast and flexible searching of structured and unstructured data. With its rich set of features and easy integration with Swift, Elasticsearch is an excellent choice for building a document search engine.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Swift programming language installed
2. Xcode or any preferred Swift development environment set up
3. Elasticsearch installed and running

## Step 1: Set up Elasticsearch

First, we need to set up Elasticsearch. You can download it from the official Elasticsearch website and follow the installation instructions for your specific platform.

Once Elasticsearch is installed, start the Elasticsearch server by running the appropriate command for your operating system.

## Step 2: Indexing Documents

Next, we need to index the documents we want to search. In this example, let's assume we have a collection of JSON documents stored in an array.

We will use the Elasticsearch Swift client library, `SwiftElasticsearch`, to interact with Elasticsearch. You can add this library to your Swift project using [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

Here's an example of how to index a document using `SwiftElasticsearch`:

```swift
import SwiftElasticsearch

let client = ElasticsearchClient()

let document: [String: Any] = [
    "title": "Example Document",
    "content": "This is an example document for testing.",
    "author": "John Doe"
]

do {
    try client.create(index: "documents", id: "1", document: document)
} catch {
    // Handle error
}
```

In the above example, we create an Elasticsearch client, define a document as a dictionary, and index it in the "documents" index with the ID "1".

## Step 3: Searching Documents

Now that we have indexed our documents, let's perform a search query to retrieve relevant results. Elasticsearch provides powerful search capabilities, including full-text search, faceted search, and fuzzy search.

Here's an example of how to perform a full-text search using `SwiftElasticsearch`:

```swift
let query: [String: Any] = [
    "query": [
        "match": [
            "title": "example"
        ]
    ]
]

do {
    let response = try client.search(index: "documents", body: query)
    let hits = response["hits"]["hits"].arrayValue
    
    for hit in hits {
        let document = hit["_source"]
        let title = document["title"].stringValue
        let score = hit["_score"].doubleValue
        
        print("\(title) - Score: \(score)")
    }
} catch {
    // Handle error
}
```

In the above example, we construct a query that searches for documents with the word "example" in the title field. We then execute the search query and iterate over the search results to retrieve the document title and score.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to build a document search engine using Swift and Elasticsearch. We covered the steps to set up Elasticsearch, index documents, and perform search queries using the `SwiftElasticsearch` library. With this knowledge, you can now build powerful search functionality in your Swift applications.
