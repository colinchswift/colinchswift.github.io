Building document-based apps in Swift brings a unique set of challenges, and one of them is handling the saving and restoring of document states. In this blog post, we will explore how to automatically save and restore document states in Swift document-based apps, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Understanding Document States

Document states in a document-based app represent the various stages a document can be in throughout its lifecycle. Some common document states include:

- New: When a document is newly created but not yet saved.
- Saved: When a document has been successfully saved to disk.
- Edited: When a document has unsaved changes.
- Closed: When a document is closed and no longer visible to the user.

By automatically saving and restoring document states, we can provide users with a smooth workflow, preserving their progress and allowing them to pick up where they left off.

## Implementing State Preservation and Restoration

To enable automatic state preservation and restoration in a Swift document-based app, we need to make use of two key classes: `UIDocument` and `UIDocumentBrowserViewController`.

### 1. Subclassing `UIDocument`

Create a subclass of `UIDocument` for your app's document type. Override the `func contents(forType typeName: String) -> Any` method to return the data that represents the document's state. Additionally, override the `func load(fromContents contents: Any, ofType typeName: String?)` method to restore the document's state from the given data.

```swift
import UIKit

class MyDocument: UIDocument {
    // Override to return the document's data representation
    override func contents(forType typeName: String) throws -> Any {
        // Return the data representing the document's state
    }
    
    // Override to restore the document's state from the given data
    override func load(fromContents contents: Any, ofType typeName: String?) throws {
        // Restore the document's state from the given data
    }
}
```

### 2. Managing Document-Based App Lifecycle with `UIDocumentBrowserViewController`

In your app's view controller, which is managed by `UIDocumentBrowserViewController`, implement the `func configureForOpeningDocument(_ document: UIDocument)` method to configure your app's UI based on the document's state.

```swift
import UIKit

class MyViewController: UIViewController, UIDocumentBrowserViewControllerDelegate {
    // Configure the app's UI based on the opened document's state
    func configureForOpeningDocument(_ document: UIDocument) {
        if document.documentState == .normal {
            // Document has been successfully loaded and restored
        } else if document.documentState == .closed {
            // Document is closed and no longer visible
        } else if document.documentState == .inConflict {
            // Document is in conflict with other versions
        } else if document.documentState.contains(.savingError) {
            // Error occurred while saving the document
        }
    }
    
    // Override to implement UIDocumentBrowserViewControllerDelegate methods
}
```

### 3. Enabling State Preservation and Restoration

To enable state preservation and restoration in your app, add the following code to your app's AppDelegate:

```swift
import UIKit

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, shouldSaveSecureApplicationState coder: NSCoder) -> Bool {
        return true
    }
    
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, shouldRestoreSecureApplicationState coder: NSCoder) -> Bool {
        return true
    }
    
    // Other AppDelegate methods
}
```

By returning `true` from the `application(_:shouldSaveSecureApplicationState:)` and `application(_:shouldRestoreSecureApplicationState:)` methods, you are enabling state preservation and restoration.

## Conclusion

Implementing automatic state preservation and restoration in Swift document-based apps ensures a seamless user experience, allowing users to easily save their progress and pick up where they left off. By subclassing `UIDocument`, managing app lifecycle with `UIDocumentBrowserViewController`, and enabling state preservation and restoration in your app's AppDelegate, you can provide a smooth and intuitive user experience in your document-based app.
