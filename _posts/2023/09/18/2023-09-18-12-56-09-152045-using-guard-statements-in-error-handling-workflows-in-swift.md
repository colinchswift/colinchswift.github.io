Error handling is an essential part of any robust application development. Swift provides several ways to handle errors, and one of the most common approaches is by using guard statements.

Guard statements allow you to check for certain conditions and exit early if those conditions are not met. They are especially useful in error handling workflows to ensure that required conditions are satisfied before proceeding with the rest of the code.

Here's an example of using guard statements in an error handling workflow in Swift:

```swift
func performOperation(input: Int) throws -> Int {
    // Use guard statement to ensure input is positive
    guard input > 0 else {
        throw NSError(domain: "com.example.app", code: 1, userInfo: nil)
    }

    // Use guard statement to ensure input is not divisible by 2
    guard input % 2 != 0 else {
        throw NSError(domain: "com.example.app", code: 2, userInfo: nil)
    }

    // Perform operation
    return input * 2
}

do {
    let result = try performOperation(input: 5)
    print("Result: \(result)")
} catch let error as NSError {
    print("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

In the above code, the `performOperation` function takes an integer input and performs a specific operation on it. However, before proceeding with the operation, guard statements are used to check if the input meets certain conditions.

If the input is not greater than 0, the first guard statement throws an error with the domain "com.example.app" and code 1. Similarly, if the input is divisible by 2, the second guard statement throws an error with the domain "com.example.app" and code 2.

By using guard statements, we can ensure that our code only continues executing if all the required conditions are satisfied. If any condition fails, an error is thrown, which can be caught and handled using a do-catch block.

Using guard statements in error handling workflows not only helps in writing clean and readable code but also ensures that potential issues or incorrect inputs are captured early and handled appropriately.
