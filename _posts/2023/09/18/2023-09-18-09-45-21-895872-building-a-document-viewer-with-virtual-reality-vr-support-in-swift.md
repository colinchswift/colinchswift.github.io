In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a document viewer with virtual reality (VR) support using Swift programming language. With VR becoming increasingly popular, incorporating VR into document viewers can provide a more immersive and interactive experience for users.

## Prerequisites:
- Xcode 11.0 or newer
- iOS device with iOS 13.0 or newer, supporting VR capabilities
- Basic familiarity with Swift programming language

## Step 1: Setting up the Project
1. Launch Xcode and create a new iOS project.
2. Choose the "Single View App" template.
3. Fill in the necessary project details and choose a location to save your project.
4. Make sure to select the "Swift" as the language for development.

## Step 2: Adding VR Support
1. Add the necessary frameworks to your project. Go to the "Project Navigator" panel, select the project, and navigate to the "General" tab. In the "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" section, click the "+" button.
2. Add the following frameworks:
- SceneKit
- ARKit
- Metal
- MetalKit

## Step 3: Designing the Document Viewer Interface
1. Open the Main.storyboard file.
2. Add a `SCNView` to your view controller's scene.
3. Configure the `SCNView` to occupy the full screen and enable VR mode by setting the `isVirtualRealitySupported` property to true.
4. Add a button to your view controller's scene to simulate document interaction.

## Step 4: Implementing the Document Viewer
1. Open the ViewController.swift file.
2. Import the necessary frameworks at the beginning of the file:
```swift
import UIKit
import SceneKit
import ARKit
```
3. Create a reference to the `SCNView` in the view controller:
```swift
@IBOutlet weak var sceneView: SCNView!
```
4. Implement the necessary setup code in the `viewDidLoad()` method:
```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    
    // Configure the scene view
    sceneView.scene = SCNScene()
    sceneView.autoenablesDefaultLighting = true
    sceneView.allowsCameraControl = true
}
```
5. Add a method to handle the document interaction button action:
```swift
@IBAction func openDocumentButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
    // Implement your code to open and display the document
    
    // Create a 3D model or scene to represent the document
    
    // Add the document representation to the scene view
}
```

## Step 5: Testing the Document Viewer
1. Connect your iOS device to your computer.
2. Select your device as the deployment target in Xcode.
3. Build and run the project on your iOS device.
4. Tap the "Open Document" button to simulate document interaction.
5. Verify that the document representation is displayed correctly in the VR-enabled `SCNView`.

Congratulations! You have successfully built a document viewer with virtual reality (VR) support using Swift. You can now enhance your application by adding additional features such as document navigation, interaction, and rendering optimizations.
