Document classification and tagging have become crucial tasks in various industries, such as content management, customer support, and information retrieval. Automating these tasks can greatly improve efficiency and accuracy. In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement automated document classification and tagging using Swift.

## Step 1: Install Core ML

To begin, we need to install Core ML, Apple's machine learning framework for iOS and macOS. Open your Xcode project, navigate to File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency, and search for "Core ML". Select the latest version, and click Next to install it into your project.

## Step 2: Prepare Training Data

Next, we need to prepare the training data for our document classification model. Create a dataset of documents and assign appropriate categories or tags to each document. Ensure that you have a sufficient amount of labeled data to train an accurate model.

## Step 3: Train Machine Learning Model

Using the labeled training data, you can train a machine learning model for document classification. There are various algorithms available, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, or Neural Networks. Choose an algorithm that is suitable for your specific use case and gather the necessary training features.

```swift
// Example code for training a document classification model
import CreateML

let trainingData = try MLDataTable(contentsOf: URL(fileURLWithPath: "training_data.csv"))
let classifier = try MLTextClassifier(trainingData: trainingData, textColumn: "text", labelColumn: "label")
let evaluationMetrics = classifier.evaluation(on: trainingData)
try classifier.write(to: URL(fileURLWithPath: "DocumentClassifier.mlmodel"))
```

In the above code, we load the training data from a CSV file, create a text classifier model, and evaluate it. Finally, we save the trained model to a `.mlmodel` file.

## Step 4: Integrate Model into Your App

Once you have trained your model, you can integrate it into your Swift app. Add the saved `.mlmodel` file to your Xcode project.

```swift
// Example code for using the document classification model in your app
import CoreML

let documentClassifier = try DocumentClassifier(configuration: MLModelConfiguration())
let document = "This is a sample document."
let classification = try documentClassifier.prediction(from: document)
print(classification.label)
```
In the above code, we import CoreML and initialize the `DocumentClassifier` model using the saved `.mlmodel` file. We then make predictions on a sample document and retrieve the predicted label.

## Step 5: Improve and Fine-Tune

To improve the accuracy of your document classification model, you can fine-tune it by iterating through Steps 2-4, gathering more data, experimenting with different algorithms, or using techniques like transfer learning.

## Conclusion

Implementing automated document classification and tagging in Swift can significantly enhance document management and organization in your app. By leveraging Core ML and training a machine learning model, you can automate the classification and tagging process, saving time and increasing accuracy. Remember to continuously improve and fine-tune your model to achieve optimal results.
