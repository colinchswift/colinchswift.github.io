In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant advancements in various fields, including document recommendation systems. These systems can effectively analyze user preferences and suggest relevant documents based on their interests. In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement an AI-powered document recommendation system in Swift.

## Prerequisites

To get started, make sure you have the following:

- Xcode installed on your machine
- Basic knowledge of Swift programming language

## Setting Up the Project

1. Open Xcode and create a new Swift project.
2. In the project navigator, right-click on the project folder and select "New Group" to create a new group named "Models."
3. Inside the "Models" group, right-click and select "New File." Choose "Swift File" and name it "DocumentRecommendationModel.swift."

## Creating the Document Recommendation Model

In the "DocumentRecommendationModel.swift" file, let's create a class that will handle the document recommendation logic.

```swift
import Foundation

class DocumentRecommendationModel {
    // Implement the document recommendation logic here
    
    func recommendDocuments(forUser user: User) -> [Document] {
        // Retrieve user preferences and analyze documents
        
        // Apply AI algorithms to generate document recommendations
        
        // Return the recommended documents
        return recommendedDocuments
    }
}
```

## Building the User and Document Models

Before we can recommend documents, we need to define our user and document models. Create another Swift file named "UserModel.swift" inside the "Models" group.

```swift
import Foundation

struct User {
    let id: Int
    let name: String
    var preferences: [String]
}

struct Document {
    let id: Int
    let title: String
    let content: String
    let category: String
}
```

## Implementing the Document Recommendation Logic

Now let's implement the document recommendation logic in the `recommendDocuments` method of the `DocumentRecommendationModel` class.

```swift
func recommendDocuments(forUser user: User) -> [Document] {
    // Filter documents based on user preferences
    let filteredDocuments = allDocuments.filter { document in
        user.preferences.contains(document.category)
    }
    
    // Sort filtered documents based on relevance score (implement your own scoring algorithm)
    let sortedDocuments = filteredDocuments.sorted { document1, document2 in
        // Compare and score the documents based on certain criteria
    }
    
    // Return the top recommended documents
    let topDocuments = Array(sortedDocuments.prefix(5))
    return topDocuments
}
```

## Testing the Document Recommendation Model

To test the document recommendation model, you can create a sample user and call the `recommendDocuments` method with that user.

```swift
let userModel = User(id: 1, name: "John Doe", preferences: ["Technology", "Science"])
let documentRecommendationModel = DocumentRecommendationModel()

let recommendedDocuments = documentRecommendationModel.recommendDocuments(forUser: userModel)
print(recommendedDocuments)
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented an AI-powered document recommendation system based on user preferences in Swift. This model can be extended further by integrating advanced machine learning algorithms and analyzing user interaction patterns to improve document recommendations.
