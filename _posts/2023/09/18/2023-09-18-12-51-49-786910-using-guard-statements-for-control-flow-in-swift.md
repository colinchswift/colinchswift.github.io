In Swift, control flow statements play a crucial role in determining the execution path of our code. One commonly used control flow statement is the `if` statement, which allows us to execute certain code only if a specific condition is true. However, when dealing with scenarios where we need to validate conditions and handle the failure case early, the `guard` statement comes to our rescue.

The `guard` statement provides a concise and elegant way to manage control flow by checking for conditions and potentially exiting early from a scope. It works by specifying a condition that must be true for the execution to continue beyond the `guard` statement.

## Syntax
```swift
func processValue(_ value: Int?) {
    guard let unwrappedValue = value else {
        // handle the failure case
        return
    }
    
    // execute code when the condition is satisfied
    print("The value is: \(unwrappedValue)")
}
```

## How does it work?
- A `guard` statement starts with the keyword `guard`, followed by a condition that must evaluate to either `true` or `false`.
- If the condition evaluates to `false`, the code inside the `else` block is executed, and the control flow is transferred outside the current code block or function.
- The `else` block typically contains code to handle the failure case, which may include returning from the function, throwing an error, or simply logging an error message.
- If the condition evaluates to `true`, the code outside the `guard` statement continues to execute.

## Benefits of using Guard Statements
1. **Early exit**: Guard statements help us handle failure cases early in our code, improving readability and reducing nested if-statements.
2. **Reduced cognitive load**: By eliminating unnecessary nesting, guard statements make code more readable and easier to understand.
3. **Automatic unwrapping**: We can leverage `guard` statements to safely unwrap optionals and bind their values to a non-optional variable, reducing the need for force unwrapping or optional chaining.

## Example Usage

```swift
func calculateAverage(of numbers: [Int]?) -> Double {
    guard let numbers = numbers, !numbers.isEmpty else {
        // Handle the failure case or return a default value
        return 0.0
    }
    
    let sum = numbers.reduce(0, +)
    let average = Double(sum) / Double(numbers.count)
    
    return average
}
```

In this example, the `guard` statement is used to check for the presence of the `numbers` array. If the array is either `nil` or empty, the function returns a default value of 0.0. Otherwise, the function proceeds to calculate the average of the numbers.

Guard statements are a powerful addition to the Swift programming language, enabling us to write more robust and readable code. By leveraging guard statements, we can handle failure cases early and improve the overall flow and clarity of our code.
