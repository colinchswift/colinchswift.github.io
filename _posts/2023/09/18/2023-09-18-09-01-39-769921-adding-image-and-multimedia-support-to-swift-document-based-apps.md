In today's digital age, multimedia content has become an integral part of our lives. Whether it's images, videos, or audio files, incorporating multimedia support into your Swift document-based app can greatly enhance the user experience. In this blog post, we will explore how to add image and multimedia support to your Swift document-based apps.

## Image Support

To enable image support in your Swift document-based app, you can leverage the `NSImage` class provided by the AppKit framework. Here's an example code snippet to guide you:

```swift
import Cocoa

class Document: NSDocument {
    var image: NSImage?

    override func makeWindowControllers() {
        // Create a window controller and set its content view
        let windowController = NSStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil).instantiateInitialController() as! NSWindowController
        windowController.contentViewController?.representedObject = image

        // Add the window controller to the document
        addWindowController(windowController)
    }

    override func read(from data: Data, ofType typeName: String) throws {
        // Instantiate an NSImage from the provided data
        if let loadedImage = NSImage(data: data) {
            image = loadedImage
        } else {
            throw NSError(domain: NSOSStatusErrorDomain, code: unimpErr, userInfo: nil)
        }
    }

    override func data(ofType typeName: String) throws -> Data {
        // Convert the image to JPEG representation
        guard let image = image else { throw NSError(domain: NSOSStatusErrorDomain, code: unimpErr, userInfo: nil) }
        guard let data = image.jpegRepresentation else { throw NSError(domain: NSOSStatusErrorDomain, code: unimpErr, userInfo: nil) }
        return data
    }
}
```

## Multimedia Support

Apart from images, you may also want to add support for audio and video files in your Swift document-based app. To accomplish this, you can utilize the `AVPlayerView` class provided by the AVKit framework. Here's an example code snippet to get started with multimedia support:

```swift
import Cocoa
import AVKit

class Document: NSDocument {
    var playerView: AVPlayerView?

    override func makeWindowControllers() {
        // Create a window controller and set its content view
        let windowController = NSStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil).instantiateInitialController() as! NSWindowController
        windowController.contentViewController?.representedObject = playerView

        // Add the window controller to the document
        addWindowController(windowController)
    }

    override func read(from data: Data, ofType typeName: String) throws {
        // Instantiate an AVPlayer with the provided data
        let player = AVPlayer(data: data)
        playerView = AVPlayerView(frame: NSRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 800, height: 600))
        playerView?.player = player
    }

    override func data(ofType typeName: String) throws -> Data {
        // Convert the player's current item to data
        guard let playerView = playerView else { throw NSError(domain: NSOSStatusErrorDomain, code: unimpErr, userInfo: nil) }
        guard let currentItem = playerView.player?.currentItem else { throw NSError(domain: NSOSStatusErrorDomain, code: unimpErr, userInfo: nil) }
        guard let data = currentItem.asset.data else { throw NSError(domain: NSOSStatusErrorDomain, code: unimpErr, userInfo: nil) }
        return data
    }
}
```
