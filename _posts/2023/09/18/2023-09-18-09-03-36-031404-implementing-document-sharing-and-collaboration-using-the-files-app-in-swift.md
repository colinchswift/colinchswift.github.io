With the advent of iOS 11, Apple introduced the Files app, which provides a unified interface for accessing and managing files on iOS devices. One powerful feature of the Files app is the ability to enable document sharing and collaboration within your app. In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement document sharing and collaboration using the Files app in Swift.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, ensure that you have the following:

- Xcode installed on your macOS machine
- Basic understanding of Swift programming language
- Basic knowledge of iOS app development using UIKit

## Step 1: Setup

Create a new Swift project in Xcode and name it *DocumentSharingCollab*.

## Step 2: Enable Document Sharing

To enable document sharing in your app, you need to configure your app's *Info.plist* file. Open the *Info.plist* file and add the following key-value pair:

```swift
<key>UIFileSharingEnabled</key>
<true/>
```

This key-value pair will allow your app to share files with other apps.

## Step 3: Implement Document Sharing

Implement a button that allows the user to export a document from your app to the Files app. Add the following code to the *ViewController.swift* file:

```swift
@IBAction func exportDocumentButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
    let documentURL = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)[0].appendingPathComponent("example.txt")
    
    let activityViewController = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: [documentURL], applicationActivities: nil)
    activityViewController.popoverPresentationController?.sourceView = view
    present(activityViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

This code retrieves the URL for a document in your app's document directory and presents a *UIActivityViewController* to allow the user to share the document.

## Step 4: Handle Shared Documents

To handle documents shared from other apps, implement the *application(_:open:options:)* method in your app's delegate. Add the following code to the *AppDelegate.swift* file:

```swift
func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
    // Handle the shared document URL here
    // ...
    return true
}
```

In this method, you can handle the shared document URL and perform any necessary actions, such as importing the document into your app.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to implement document sharing and collaboration using the Files app in Swift. By enabling document sharing, you allow users to easily export and import documents between your app and other apps on their iOS devices. This feature enhances the usability and functionality of your app, making it more versatile for users.
