Sets are a powerful collection type in Swift that allow you to store distinct values of the same type. They provide several useful functions that can help you work with sets more efficiently. In this blog post, we will explore some of the commonly used set functions in Swift.

## 1. Creating a Set

First, let's see how to create a set in Swift. You can define a set using the `Set` keyword, followed by the type of elements it will contain, enclosed in angle brackets:

```swift
var fruitsSet: Set<String> = ["Apple", "Orange", "Banana"]
```

This creates a set named `fruitsSet` with three initial elements: "Apple", "Orange", and "Banana".

## 2. Adding and Removing Elements

To add a new element to a set, you can use the `insert(_:)` function. Similarly, to remove an element from a set, you can use the `remove(_:)` function.

```swift
fruitsSet.insert("Mango")
fruitsSet.remove("Orange")
```

The `insert(_:)` function adds the element "Mango" to the set, while `remove(_:)` function removes the element "Orange" from the set.

## 3. Set Operations

Sets in Swift provide various operations that can be performed on them. Some of the commonly used set functions are:

- `union(_:)`: Returns a new set that contains all the elements from both sets.
- `intersection(_:)`: Returns a new set that contains only the common elements between both sets.
- `subtracting(_:)`: Returns a new set that contains the elements from the first set that are not in the second set.
- `symmetricDifference(_:)`: Returns a new set that contains the elements that are either in the first set or the second set, but not both.

Here is an example that demonstrates the usage of these set functions:

```swift
let set1: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4]
let set2: Set<Int> = [3, 4, 5, 6]

let unionSet = set1.union(set2)
let intersectionSet = set1.intersection(set2)
let subtractingSet = set1.subtracting(set2)
let symmetricDifferenceSet = set1.symmetricDifference(set2)
```

## 4. Checking for Membership and Subsets

You can check if a set contains a specific element using the `contains(_:)` function. Additionally, you can check if one set is a subset or superset of another set using the `isSubset(of:)` and `isSuperset(of:)` functions respectively.

```swift
let fruitsSet: Set<String> = ["Apple", "Orange", "Banana"]
let isFruit = fruitsSet.contains("Apple")

let set1: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4]
let set2: Set<Int> = [1, 2]

let isSubset = set2.isSubset(of: set1)
let isSuperset = set1.isSuperset(of: set2)
```

The `contains(_:)` function returns a boolean indicating whether the set contains the element. The `isSubset(of:)` and `isSuperset(of:)` functions return true if the first set is a subset or superset of the second set respectively.

## Conclusion

Swift provides powerful set functions that simplify working with sets. By leveraging these functions, you can perform set operations, check for membership, and determine subsets and supersets more efficiently. Incorporate these functions into your Swift code to enhance your set operations and improve your productivity.
