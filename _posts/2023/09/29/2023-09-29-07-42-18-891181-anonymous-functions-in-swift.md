In Swift, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be assigned to variables, passed as parameters to other functions, and returned from functions. One powerful feature of functions in Swift is the ability to define *anonymous functions*, also known as *closures*. Anonymous functions allow you to write concise and flexible code.

## Syntax

The syntax for declaring an anonymous function in Swift is as follows:

```swift
{ (parameters) -> ReturnType in
    // Code block
    // Statements
    // Return expression
}
```

Let's break down the syntax:

- The opening and closing curly braces `{ }` define the body of the anonymous function.
- Inside the parentheses `parameters`, you can specify the input parameters for the function. These parameters are separated by commas.
- The `ReturnType` specifies the expected return type of the function. If the function doesn't return a value, you can use `Void`.
- After the `in` keyword, you write the actual code block of the function.
- Inside the code block, you can write any number of statements and expressions.
- If the function has a return value, you can use the `return` keyword followed by the expression to be returned.

## Examples

Here are a few examples to illustrate how anonymous functions can be used:

1. **Basic Usage**

```swift
let add: (Int, Int) -> Int = { (a, b) in
    return a + b
}
print(add(3, 5))  // Output: 8
```

In this example, we define an anonymous function `add` that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum. We assign this function to a variable `add` with type annotation `(Int, Int) -> Int`, indicating the parameter types and return type.

2. **No Return Value**

```swift
let greet: () -> Void = {
    print("Hello, Swift!")
}
greet()  // Output: Hello, Swift!
```

In this example, we define an anonymous function `greet` that takes no parameters and has no return value. We assign this function to a variable `greet` with type annotation `() -> Void`. When we call `greet()`, it prints the message "Hello, Swift!".

## Conclusion

Anonymous functions are a powerful feature in Swift that allow you to write concise and flexible code. They can be used in various scenarios, such as defining simple one-off functions or passing functions as parameters to other functions. By understanding anonymous functions, you can write more expressive and efficient Swift code.
