Arrays are an important data structure in many programming languages, including Swift. They allow you to store and manipulate collections of values. Swift provides a variety of built-in array functions that can help you perform common operations on arrays efficiently. In this blog post, we will explore some of these useful array functions and see how they can be applied in Swift.

## 1. `map`

The `map` function is used to transform each element in an array into a new value. It takes a closure as an argument, which specifies the transformation logic. The `map` function returns a new array with the transformed values.

Here is an example demonstrating the usage of `map`:

```swift
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let squaredNumbers = numbers.map { $0 * $0 }
print(squaredNumbers) // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

In this code snippet, we have an array `numbers` containing some integers. We apply the `map` function to square each number in the array and store the results in `squaredNumbers`.

## 2. `filter`

The `filter` function allows you to create a new array containing only the elements that satisfy a certain condition. It takes a closure that specifies the condition and returns a Boolean value. Only the elements for which the closure returns `true` will be included in the resulting array.

Here is an example demonstrating the usage of `filter`:

```swift
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let evenNumbers = numbers.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }
print(evenNumbers) // Output: [2, 4]
```

In this code snippet, we use the `filter` function to extract only the even numbers from the `numbers` array. The closure checks if each number is divisible by 2 and returns `true` if it is.

These are just a few examples of the many array functions available in Swift. By using these functions effectively, you can simplify your code and perform operations on arrays more efficiently.
