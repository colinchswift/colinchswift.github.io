In Swift, functions can be defined inside other functions. These functions are called nested functions. Nested functions can be useful when we need to define a helper function that is only used within a larger function.

## Syntax

The syntax for declaring a nested function in Swift is as follows:

```swift
func outerFunction() {
    func innerFunction() {
        // inner function code
    }
    // outer function code
}
```

The nested function `innerFunction` is only accessible within the scope of the `outerFunction`. It cannot be called from outside the `outerFunction`.

## Example

Let's say we have a function named `calculateDiscount` that calculates the discount for a given price based on a certain condition. We can use a nested function called `applyDiscount` inside `calculateDiscount` to perform the actual calculation.

```swift
func calculateDiscount(price: Double) -> Double {
    func applyDiscount(price: Double, percentage: Double) -> Double {
        let discount = price * percentage
        return price - discount
    }
    
    if price > 100 {
        return applyDiscount(price: price, percentage: 0.1)
    } else {
        return price
    }
}
```

In the example above, the nested function `applyDiscount` takes two parameters: `price` and `percentage`, and returns a discounted price. The `calculateDiscount` function calls the `applyDiscount` function inside an `if` statement to apply a discount of 10% if the price is greater than 100.

## Benefits of Nested Functions

Nested functions offer several benefits:

1. **Encapsulation**: Nested functions encapsulate functionality within a larger function, preventing them from being accessed outside of the parent function. This helps to maintain code cleanliness and organization.

2. **Code Reusability**: Nested functions can be reused within the parent function without the need to define them elsewhere in the codebase.

3. **Readability**: By defining helper functions inside the main function, the logic becomes easier to follow, as the nested functions provide context-specific behavior.

## Conclusion

Nested functions in Swift are a powerful tool for encapsulating and reusing code within a function. They allow for cleaner and more modular code, enhancing both readability and maintainability. Consider using nested functions when you have a specific functionality that is tightly coupled with a parent function and does not need to be accessed externally.
