Keeping a consistent code style in Swift projects is crucial for maintainability and readability. Manually formatting code can be time-consuming and prone to human error. Luckily, Git hooks provide a solution to automate the process of code formatting. In this blog post, we will explore how to use Git hooks to automatically format Swift code in your projects.

### What are Git hooks?

Git hooks are scripts that Git executes at specific points during its workflow. These scripts can be customized to perform various tasks, such as validating code, enforcing style guidelines, or even preventing commits that don't meet certain criteria. Git hooks can be set up to run on both the client-side and server-side.

### Setting up Git hooks

To set up Git hooks, you need to navigate to your project's Git repository and find the `.git` directory. Inside this directory, you will see a folder called `hooks`. This is where you can place your hook scripts.

### Formatting Swift code using SwiftLint

For formatting Swift code, we will use a popular tool called SwiftLint. SwiftLint is a static analysis tool that enforces Swift style and conventions. It helps identify and automatically fix issues related to code formatting, naming conventions, and more.

To use SwiftLint as part of your Git hook, you first need to have SwiftLint installed on your machine. You can install it using Homebrew by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
brew install swiftlint
```

Once SwiftLint is installed, you can create a pre-commit Git hook script that runs SwiftLint to format your code before each commit. Inside the `.git/hooks` directory of your project, create a file named `pre-commit` (without any file extension). Paste the following code into the script file:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
if which swiftlint >/dev/null; then
  swiftlint
else
  echo "warning: SwiftLint not installed, download from https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint"
fi
```

Lastly, make the script executable by running the following command:

```bash
chmod +x pre-commit
```

### Automating code formatting with Git hooks

Now that you have set up the pre-commit Git hook, it will be executed automatically before each commit. If there are any code formatting issues, SwiftLint will highlight them in the terminal output before the commit is made.

By automating code formatting with Git hooks, you can ensure that your code follows the defined style guidelines consistently. It saves time and effort by avoiding manual code formatting and helps maintain a clean and readable codebase.
