To understand escaping closures, let's consider a scenario where we want to implement a network request manager in Swift. We want to execute a closure when the network request is complete. We can define a function `performRequest` that takes a closure as an argument:

```swift
func performRequest(completion: @escaping () -> Void) {
    // Simulating a network request
    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 2) {
        print("Network request complete")
        completion()
    }
}
```

In this example, `performRequest` takes a closure called `completion` as an argument. We use `@escaping` keyword before the closure's type to specify that it can be stored and executed later. Inside the function, we simulate a network request using `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter` and call the `completion` closure when the request is complete.

Now, let's use the `performRequest` function:

```swift
performRequest {
    print("Closure executed")
}
```

Here, we pass a trailing closure to `performRequest` that simply prints "Closure executed". This closure is stored and executed when the network request is complete.

The `@escaping` keyword ensures that the closure can be used outside the `performRequest` function's scope. Without `@escaping`, the closure would be released from memory immediately after the function's execution.

Escaping closures are useful in scenarios where you need to perform asynchronous tasks, such as API calls, where the closure needs to be executed when the response is received.

In summary, escaping closures in Swift functions allow you to pass closures as arguments, store them, and execute them later. They are particularly useful in handling asynchronous operations. #Swift #Closures
