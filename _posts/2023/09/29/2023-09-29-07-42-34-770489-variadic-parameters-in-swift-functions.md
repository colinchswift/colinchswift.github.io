When working with Swift functions, you may come across scenarios where you need to pass an arbitrary number of arguments of the same type. In such cases, using variadic parameters can be incredibly useful. Variadic parameters allow you to pass any number of values of the specified type, which is especially handy when you don't know in advance how many arguments will be passed.

## Syntax

To define a variadic parameter in a Swift function, you simply add three dots (`...`) after the parameter's type. For example:

```swift
func sum(numbers: Int...) -> Int {
    var totalSum = 0
    for number in numbers {
        totalSum += number
    }
    return totalSum
}
```

In the above code snippet, the `sum` function takes an arbitrary number of integers as arguments using the variadic parameter `numbers`. You can pass any number of integers, separated by commas, and the function will correctly calculate their sum.

## Calling a Function with Variadic Parameters

When calling a function that has variadic parameters, you can pass zero or more values of the specified type. For example:

```swift
let result = sum(numbers: 5, 10, 15, 20)
print(result) // Output: 50
```

You can also pass an array as an argument to a variadic parameter. Swift automatically spreads the elements of the array and treats them as separate arguments. For instance:

```swift
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let result = sum(numbers: numbers)
print(result) // Output: 15
```

In the above code, the `numbers` array is passed as an argument to the `sum` function. Swift automatically expands the array elements into individual arguments, resulting in the correct sum.

## Conclusion

Variadic parameters in Swift functions provide a convenient way to handle any number of arguments of the same type. By using this feature, you can create more flexible and adaptable functions that can take varying numbers of input values.
