In Swift, function overloading allows you to define multiple functions with the same name but with different parameters or return types. This feature adds flexibility and clarity to your code, as you can use the same function name for related operations.

To illustrate function overloading, let's first define two functions with the same name `calculateArea`, but with different parameter types:

```swift
func calculateArea(length: Double, width: Double) -> Double {
    return length * width
}

func calculateArea(radius: Double) -> Double {
    return Double.pi * radius * radius
}
```

In the above example, the first `calculateArea` function calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width, while the second function calculates the area of a circle by multiplying the radius with Ï€ (pi).

You can now call these functions and Swift will determine which function to execute based on the types of the arguments:

```swift
let rectangleArea = calculateArea(length: 5.0, width: 3.0)
// rectangleArea = 15.0

let circleArea = calculateArea(radius: 2.0)
// circleArea = 12.566370614359172
```

As you can see, Swift automatically selects the appropriate `calculateArea` function based on the type and number of arguments passed.

Function overloading is not limited to different parameter types. You can also use it when there's a difference in the number of parameters or in the return type. For example:

```swift
func calculateArea(side: Double) -> Double {
    return side * side
}

func calculateArea(length: Double, width: Double, height: Double) -> Double {
    return length * width * height
}

let squareArea = calculateArea(side: 4.0)
// squareArea = 16.0

let boxArea = calculateArea(length: 3.0, width: 2.0, height: 1.5)
// boxArea = 9.0
```

In this case, the first `calculateArea` function calculates the area of a square, while the second function calculates the volume of a box.

Function overloading adds readability, reusability, and flexibility to your code. It allows you to define multiple functions with the same name, catering to different scenarios based on the function's signature.

When using function overloading, ensure that the function signatures are distinct, so that Swift can correctly resolve the appropriate function to execute based on the provided arguments.
