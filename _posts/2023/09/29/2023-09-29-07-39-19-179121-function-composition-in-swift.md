Function composition is a powerful concept in functional programming that allows you to combine multiple functions into a single function. In Swift, function composition can make your code more concise, readable, and expressive. In this blog post, we will explore how function composition works in Swift and how it can be used to solve common programming problems.

## What is Function Composition?

Function composition is an operation that combines two or more functions to produce a new function. The output of one function becomes the input of the next function, forming a chain of function calls. This allows you to create complex transformations by applying a series of simple functions.

## Using the `compose` Operator

In Swift, function composition can be achieved using the `compose` operator (`>>>`). This operator takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function that is the result of applying the second function to the output of the first function.

```swift
func compose<A, B, C>(_ f: @escaping (A) -> B, _ g: @escaping (B) -> C) -> (A) -> C {
    return { x in
        g(f(x))
    }
}
```

In the above code, we define a generic `compose` function that takes two functions `f` and `g` as arguments. The function `compose` returns a new function that takes an argument `x` and applies `f` to `x` and then applies `g` to the result.

## Example Usage

Let's say we have two simple functions: `increment` and `square`. We can compose these functions to create a new function that increments a number and then squares it.

```swift
func increment(_ x: Int) -> Int {
    return x + 1
}

func square(_ x: Int) -> Int {
    return x * x
}

let incrementAndSquare = compose(increment, square)

let result = incrementAndSquare(2)  // Result is 9 (2 + 1 = 3, 3 * 3 = 9)
```

In the example above, we use the `compose` function to combine the `increment` and `square` functions into a single function `incrementAndSquare`. We then call `incrementAndSquare` with the argument `2`, which first increments the number and then squares it, resulting in `9`.

## Benefits of Function Composition

- **Code Reusability**: Function composition allows you to reuse simple functions to create more complex ones. You can combine functions in different ways to solve different problems.
- **Readability**: Function composition makes your code more readable by breaking down complex operations into a series of simple steps.
- **Flexibility**: Function composition allows you to modify the behavior of a function without changing its implementation. You can easily add, remove, or reorder functions in the composition chain.

## Conclusion

Function composition is a powerful technique in Swift that allows you to combine functions to create new ones. It can make your code more concise, readable, and flexible. By using the `compose` operator, you can easily create complex transformations by combining simple functions. So, the next time you encounter a problem that can be solved by composing functions, give it a try and see the benefits for yourself!
