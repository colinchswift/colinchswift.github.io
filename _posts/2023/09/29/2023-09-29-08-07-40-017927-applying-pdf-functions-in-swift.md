PDF (Portable Document Format) is a commonly used file format for sharing documents. In this blog post, we will explore how to work with PDF functions in Swift.

## Reading a PDF File

To read a PDF file in Swift, we can leverage the `PDFDocument` class from the `PDFKit` framework. Here's an example of how to load and display a PDF file:

```swift
import PDFKit

if let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "example", withExtension: "pdf") {
    if let pdfDocument = PDFDocument(url: url) {
        let pdfView = PDFView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 400))
        pdfView.document = pdfDocument
        
        // Add the PDF view to your interface
        
        // Perform additional operations on the PDF document
        
    } else {
        print("Failed to load PDF document")
    }
} else {
    print("PDF file not found")
}
```

In this code snippet, we first retrieve the URL of the PDF file (e.g., "example.pdf" in the app's bundle). We then create a `PDFDocument` object using the URL and assign it to a `PDFView`. Finally, we can add the `pdfView` to our user interface.

## Extracting Text from a PDF

To extract text from a PDF document in Swift, we can utilize the `string` property of a `PDFPage` object. Here's a sample code snippet that demonstrates how to retrieve text from each page of a PDF:

```swift
if let pdfDocument = PDFDocument(url: pdfURL) {
    for pageIndex in 0..<pdfDocument.pageCount {
        if let page = pdfDocument.page(at: pageIndex) {
            if let pageText = page.string {
                print("Page \(pageIndex + 1) text:\n\(pageText)")
            } else {
                print("Failed to extract text from page \(pageIndex + 1)")
            }
        } else {
            print("Failed to load page \(pageIndex + 1)")
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we loop through each page of the `pdfDocument` and retrieve the text content using the `string` property of the `PDFPage` object.

## Modifying a PDF

Swift provides a convenient way to annotate PDF documents with the help of `PDFAnnotation` class. We can create and add annotations such as text boxes, highlights, and more to the PDF file. Here's an example of adding a text annotation to a page:

```swift
if let pdfDocument = PDFDocument(url: pdfURL),
   let page = pdfDocument.page(at: pageIndex) {
    let annotation = PDFAnnotation(bounds: CGRect(x: 100, y: 200, width: 200, height: 50), forType: .freeText, withProperties: nil)
    annotation.contents = "This is a text annotation"
    page.addAnnotation(annotation)
    pdfDocument.write(to: pdfURL)
}
```

In this code snippet, we first load the `pdfDocument` and obtain a specific page using `page(at:)` method. We create an instance of `PDFAnnotation` with the desired bounds and type (in this case, a free text annotation). We then add the annotation to the page and save the modified document using `write(to:)` method.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to apply PDF functions in Swift. We covered reading a PDF file, extracting text from a PDF, and modifying a PDF by adding annotations. Swift's `PDFKit` framework provides a powerful set of tools to work with PDF files, opening up various possibilities for PDF-related functionality in your iOS or macOS applications.
