As developers, we strive to write clean and bug-free code. One way to ensure code quality is to perform static code analysis before committing our changes. Git hooks provide an excellent mechanism to automate this process, allowing us to run code analysis tools or custom scripts before every commit.

In this blog post, we will explore some best practices for using Git hooks specifically for pre-commit code analysis in Swift projects.

## 1. Choose the Right Tool
There are several static code analysis tools available for Swift, such as SwiftLint, FauxPas, and Tailor. Each tool has its own set of rules and features, so it's important to choose one that aligns with your project's coding style and requirements. **#SwiftAnalysis #CodeQuality**

## 2. Configure Git Hooks
Git hooks are scripts that are executed at certain stages of the Git workflow. To set up a pre-commit hook for code analysis, navigate to the root of your Git repository and open the `.git/hooks` directory. Create a new file named `pre-commit` (without any file extension) and make it executable. In this script, you can call the code analysis tool of your choice. **#GitHooks #PreCommit**

## 3. Customize Analysis Rules
Most code analysis tools allow you to customize their rules and configurations. Take the time to review the available options and configure the tool according to your project's needs. Customizing the rules helps to enforce code quality standards, improve maintainability, and prevent common code issues.

## 4. Use Git Branches
Before performing code analysis, it's a good practice to switch to a separate branch. This allows you to experiment with changes without affecting the main branch. If the analysis identifies any issues, you can easily make the necessary fixes and ensure that your main branch always contains high-quality, analyz
