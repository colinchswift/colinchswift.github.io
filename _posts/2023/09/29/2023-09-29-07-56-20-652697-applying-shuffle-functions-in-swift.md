When working on an iOS app, you may come across situations where you need to shuffle elements in an array randomly. This can be useful for creating a randomized order for a quiz, a deck of cards, or any scenario where you need to randomly rearrange items. In Swift, you can easily achieve this using shuffle functions.

## Using the Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm

One widely-used algorithm for shuffling an array is the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm. It works by iteratively swapping each element with a randomly selected element from the remaining unshuffled portion of the array.

Here's an example implementation of the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm in Swift:

```swift
func shuffleArray<T>(_ array: [T]) -> [T] {
    var shuffledArray = array
    
    for i in 0..<shuffledArray.count {
        let randomIndex = Int.random(in: i..<shuffledArray.count)
        shuffledArray.swapAt(i, randomIndex)
    }
    
    return shuffledArray
}
```

In this function, we create a copy of the original array and use a for loop to iterate through each element. Inside the loop, we generate a random index using `Int.random` and swap the current element with the randomly selected element. Finally, we return the shuffled array.

## Applying the Shuffle Function

To shuffle an array using the `shuffleArray` function, you simply pass your array as an argument and assign the returned shuffled array to a new variable. Here's an example of how to use this function:

```swift
let originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let shuffledArray = shuffleArray(originalArray)

print(shuffledArray)
```

Running this code will output a shuffled version of the original array, which could be something like `[2, 5, 1, 4, 3]`.

## Conclusion

Shuffling elements in an array can be done easily in Swift by applying the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm. By using the provided `shuffleArray` function, you can randomly rearrange the elements in your array. This functionality can be handy in various scenarios, such as creating randomized quizzes or games. Happy shuffling!
