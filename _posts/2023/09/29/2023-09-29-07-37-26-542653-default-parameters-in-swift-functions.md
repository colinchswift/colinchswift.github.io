In Swift, you can define functions with default parameters. This means that when calling the function, you can omit the value for a particular parameter, and the function will use the default value defined in its declaration.

Using default parameters can make your code more concise and flexible. It allows you to define a set of default values that are used most of the time, but still allows you to provide a different value when needed.

Let's see an example of a function that calculates the area of a rectangle:

```swift
func calculateArea(length: Double, width: Double = 1.0) -> Double {
    return length * width
}
```

In the above code snippet, the `width` parameter has a default value of 1.0. So if you call the `calculateArea` function without providing a value for `width`, it will use the default value of 1.0.

```swift
let area1 = calculateArea(length: 4.0) // area1 is 4.0
let area2 = calculateArea(length: 4.0, width: 2.5) // area2 is 10.0
```

In the first example, since we didn't provide a value for `width`, it used the default value of 1.0 and calculated the area as 4.0.

In the second example, we provided a different value for `width`, so it used the provided value and calculated the area as 10.0.

You can also mix default parameters with non-default parameters:

```swift
func printMessage(message: String = "Hello", to recipient: String) {
    print("\(message), \(recipient)!")
}
```

In this example, the `message` parameter has a default value of "Hello", but the `recipient` parameter doesn't have a default value. So you can call the function in two ways:

```swift
printMessage(to: "John") // prints "Hello, John!"
printMessage(message: "Hi", to: "Jane") // prints "Hi, Jane!"
```

In the first example, since we didn't provide a value for `message`, it used the default value of "Hello" and printed "Hello, John!".

In the second example, we provided a different value for `message`, so it used the provided value and printed "Hi, Jane!".

Using default parameters in Swift functions can help simplify your code and make it more flexible. It allows you to provide default values for parameters that are used most of the time, while still allowing you to customize them when needed.
