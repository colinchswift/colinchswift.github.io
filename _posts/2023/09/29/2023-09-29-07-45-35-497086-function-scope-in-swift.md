In Swift, functions are an essential part of building reusable and modular code. One key concept to understand is function scope, which refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables and constants within different parts of the code.

## Local Scope

When a variable or constant is defined inside a function, it is said to have local scope. This means that the variable or constant can only be accessed within that particular function. Once the function has finished executing, the local variable or constant is deallocated from memory, and its value is no longer accessible.

Here's an example of a function with a local variable:

```swift
func greet() {
    let message = "Hello, World!"
    print(message)
}
```

In this example, the `message` variable has a local scope and can only be accessed within the `greet()` function.

## Global Scope

In contrast to local scope, global scope refers to variables and constants that are accessible throughout the entire program. Global variables and constants are defined outside of any functions, typically at the top of the file.

Here's an example of a global variable:

```swift
let globalVariable = 10

func multiplyByGlobal(_ number: Int) -> Int {
    return number * globalVariable
}
```

In this example, the `globalVariable` can be accessed and used by any function or code block within the same file.

## Nested Scope

In Swift, functions can be nested within other functions. This creates a nested scope, where variables and constants defined in the outer function are accessible inside the inner function. However, variables defined in the inner function are not accessible in the outer function.

```swift
func outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = 10
    
    func innerFunction() {
        let innerVariable = 20
        print(outerVariable + innerVariable)
    }
    
    innerFunction()
}

outerFunction()
```

In this example, the `outerVariable` is accessible inside the `innerFunction`, but the `innerVariable` is not accessible outside of the `innerFunction`.

## Conclusion

Understanding function scope in Swift is crucial for writing clean and maintainable code. By properly defining variables and constants within the appropriate scope, you can avoid naming conflicts and improve code readability. Remember to choose the appropriate scope based on the specific needs of your program.
