1. Global Functions

Global functions are the most common and straightforward type of function in Swift. They are defined outside any class or structure and can be accessed anywhere in the code. Here's an example of a global function:

```swift
func greet(name: String) {
    print("Hello, \(name)!")
}

// Calling the function
greet(name: "John") // Output: Hello, John!
```

In the above example, we define a `greet` function that takes a `name` parameter of type `String` and prints a greeting message. We call the function with the parameter "John" to print "Hello, John!".

2. Nested Functions

Nested functions are functions defined inside another function. They are not accessible outside the enclosing function and can only be called from within. Nested functions can be useful for organizing code and keeping related functionality together. Here's an example of a nested function:

```swift
func performOperation() {
    func add(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int {
        return a + b
    }
    
    let result = add(a: 5, b: 3)
    print("Result: \(result)")
}

// Calling the function
performOperation() // Output: Result: 8
```

In the above example, we define a `performOperation` function that contains a nested function `add`. The `add` function takes two parameters `a` and `b` of type `Int` and returns their sum. Inside the `performOperation` function, we call the `add` function and print the result.

These are just two types of functions in Swift, but there are more advanced concepts like closures and function types. Understanding the different types of functions and when to use them can greatly improve the organization and readability of your code.
