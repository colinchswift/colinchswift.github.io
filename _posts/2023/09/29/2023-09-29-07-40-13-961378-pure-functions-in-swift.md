When working with functional programming in Swift, understanding pure functions is essential. Pure functions are a fundamental concept in functional programming and offer several benefits in terms of code maintainability and predictability. In this blog post, we will explore what pure functions are and how to write them in Swift.

## What are Pure Functions?

A pure function is a function that has two important properties:

1. It always produces the same output for the same input parameters.
2. It does not have any side effects on the application or the surrounding environment.

Let's break down these properties further:

### 1. Consistent Output:

A pure function will always return the same output when given the same input parameters. This predictability makes the function easier to reason about and test. By removing any reliance on mutable state or external dependencies, pure functions ensure a consistent behavior regardless of the program's state.

### 2. No Side Effects:

Side effects refer to any changes made by a function beyond the scope of its return value. In the context of pure functions, it means that the function does not modify any external state, mutate any data, or perform I/O operations. Pure functions purely rely on their input parameters and return a value based on those inputs.

## Benefits of Pure Functions

Using pure functions in your Swift code provides several benefits:

1. **Testability**: Since pure functions only depend on their input parameters and their return value, they are easier to test in isolation. You can pass different inputs and verify the expected output without worrying about external state or dependencies.

2. **Code Maintainability**: Pure functions are less prone to introducing bugs because they don't have hidden side effects. They offer a high level of predictability, making it easier to reason about their behavior and track down issues in your code.

3. **Concurrency**: Pure functions can be safely executed in parallel or distributed environments without any synchronization concerns. Since they don't rely on shared mutable state, they are inherently thread-safe and can improve performance in concurrent scenarios.

## Writing Pure Functions in Swift

To write a pure function in Swift, follow these guidelines:

1. Avoid modifying or mutating any external state within the function.
2. Do not rely on global variables or properties that can change.
3. Ensure the function's return value solely depends on its input parameters.
4. Do not perform any I/O operations, such as reading or writing files, within the function.

Here's an example of a pure function in Swift:

```swift
// A pure function to calculate the square of a number
func square(_ number: Int) -> Int {
    return number * number
}
```

In this example, the `square` function takes an integer as input and returns the square of that number. It does not modify any external state or rely on any mutable variables to calculate the result.

By following these principles and designing your functions to be pure, you can enhance the reliability and maintainability of your Swift codebase.
