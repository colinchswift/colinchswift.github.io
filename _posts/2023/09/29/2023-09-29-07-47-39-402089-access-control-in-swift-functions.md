When developing applications in Swift, it is essential to understand access control to ensure that your code is secure and organized. Access control allows you to define the level of access that other entities, such as functions and variables, have to your code. In this blog post, we will focus on access control in Swift functions.

## Public Functions

By default, Swift functions are **internal**, which means they can be accessed from within the module where they are defined. However, you can mark a function as **public** to make it accessible from other modules as well. Public functions are commonly used in frameworks or libraries, enabling other developers to utilize and interact with specific functionality.

```swift
public func calculateArea(length: Double, width: Double) -> Double {
    return length * width
}
```
## Private Functions

On the other hand, **private** functions are only accessible within the same source file. They cannot be accessed from outside the file, including other modules. Private functions are useful for encapsulating internal implementation details and improving code readability and maintainability.

```swift
private func validateInput(length: Double, width: Double) -> Bool {
    return length > 0 && width > 0
}
```

## Internal Functions

Internal functions, as mentioned earlier, are the default access level in Swift. They can be accessed from any source file within the same module but are not accessible from other modules. These functions are suitable for most situations, where you only need to expose functionality to other parts of the module.

```swift
internal func logError(message: String) {
    print("[ERROR] " + message)
}
```

## File-private Functions

In addition to private and internal functions, Swift provides the option to mark a function with **file-private** access. A file-private function restricts access to the entire source file containing the function declaration. No other source file within the same module can access this function. This access level is useful for small-scale projects or when you want to limit certain functions within a specific file for organizational purposes.

```swift
fileprivate func processInput(data: Data) {
    // Process input data here
}
```

## Conclusion

Access control in Swift functions gives you the ability to define the visibility and accessibility of your code. By using public, private, internal, and file-private access levels as needed, you can enhance code maintainability, encapsulate implementation details, and ensure the security of your application.

Remember to consider the level of access control carefully when designing your functions to ensure that your codebase meets your specific requirements.
