In Swift, function attributes provide additional information or modify the behavior of functions. They allow you to add certain characteristics to functions, making them more versatile and flexible. In this article, we will explore some commonly used function attributes in Swift.

## @discardableResult

The `@discardableResult` attribute is used when you want to ignore the return value of a function. By default, Swift generates a warning if you call a function that returns a value but don't use it. However, by applying the `@discardableResult` attribute to a function declaration, you can suppress this warning.

```swift
@discardableResult
func calculateSum(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int {
    return a + b
}

let result = calculateSum(a: 3, b: 5) // The return value is ignored without generating a warning
```

## @autoclosure

The `@autoclosure` attribute is used to automatically convert an expression into a closure. It allows you to delay the evaluation of an expression until it is actually needed. This attribute is commonly used in combination with conditional expressions or boolean operations.

```swift
func log(_ message: @autoclosure () -> String) {
    print(message())
}

log("This message will be printed") // The message expression is automatically converted into a closure

func divide(dividend: Int, by divisor: Int) -> Int? {
    guard divisor != 0 else {
        return nil
    }
    return dividend / divisor
}

if let result = divide(dividend: 10, by: 5), result > 0 {
    log("Division result is positive")
} else {
    log("Division failed or result is non-positive")
}
```

## Conclusion

Function attributes in Swift provide a way to enhance the behavior and flexibility of functions. The `@discardableResult` attribute allows you to instruct the compiler to ignore the return value of a function, while the `@autoclosure` attribute permits you to delay the evaluation of an expression until needed. Understanding and utilizing these attributes can greatly improve the functionality and readability of your code.
