When working on Swift projects using Git as the version control system, you may often encounter situations where you need to temporarily store your code changes without committing them. Git stash is a handy feature that allows you to do just that. In this blog post, we will explore how to use Git stash effectively in Swift projects.

## What is Git Stash?

Git stash is a feature provided by Git that allows you to save your changes on a temporary storage area, allowing you to switch to a different branch or work on something else without committing your changes. It effectively allows you to "stash away" your changes and revert your working directory to a clean state.

## Stashing Code Changes

To stash your code changes using Git, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to your Swift project's root directory.
2. Make sure you have no uncommitted changes in your working directory. You can check this by running `git status`.
3. Run the following command to stash your changes:
   ```
   git stash save "Your stash message here" 
   ```
   Replace "Your stash message here" with a descriptive message that helps you identify the changes later.

## Applying and Listing Stashes

Once you have stashed your changes, you can apply or list them using the following commands:

- To apply a stash and apply the changes to your current working directory, use the command:
  ```
  git stash apply
  ```
  This will apply the most recent stash. If you have multiple stashes, you can specify a specific stash by using its stash reference, e.g., `git stash apply stash@{2}`.

- To list all your stashes, use the command:
  ```
  git stash list
  ```

## Discarding and Clearing Stashes

If you no longer need a specific stash, you can discard it using the following command:

```
git stash drop stash@{2}
```
Replace `stash@{2}` with the appropriate stash reference to discard a specific stash.

To clear all stashes and remove them from the stash list, run:

```
git stash clear
```
Note that this action cannot be undone, so make sure you have no important stashes before executing this command.

## Conclusion

Git stash is a powerful tool when it comes to managing temporary code changes in Swift projects. It allows you to quickly switch between branches or work on different features without cluttering your commit history. By mastering the git stash commands, you can easily stash and apply code changes as needed, making your development process more efficient and organized.
