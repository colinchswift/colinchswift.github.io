Tracking code authorship is an essential aspect of collaborative software development. Git, being a popular version control system, provides a powerful feature called "Git blame" which allows you to identify the authors of specific lines or blocks of code. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement Git blame in Swift projects using the Git command line tool.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you need to ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

1. Git is installed and configured on your development machine.
2. Your Swift project is already initialized and using Git as the version control system.

## Step 1: Install Git Blame Command Line Tool
Since Swift does not have a built-in command to perform Git blame, we need to install a third-party command line tool called `git-blame-someone-else`. To install it, open Terminal and run the following command:

```shell
$ brew install git-blame-someone-else
```

## Step 2: Add Git Blame as a Build Phase Script
To automatically track code authorship each time you build your Swift project, we can add a custom build phase script that invokes the Git blame command. Here's how to do it:

1. Open your Xcode project and select your target.
2. Go to the "Build Phases" tab.
3. Click the "+" icon and select "New Run Script Phase".
4. In the script editor, enter the following command:

```shell
/usr/local/bin/git-blame-someone-else --ignore-whitespace --ignore-ci
```

This script executes the `git-blame-someone-else` command with the specified options, ignoring whitespace changes and commits from continuous integration.

## Step 3: Build and Analyze Results
Now that you have added the Git blame script as a build phase, when you build your Swift project, Xcode will automatically track the authorship of each line of code. To analyze the results:

1. Build your project by selecting "Product > Build" from the Xcode menu.
2. Open the "Report Navigator" by pressing `Cmd + 9` or selecting the corresponding icon in the Xcode sidebar.
3. Find the latest build and expand it.
4. Look for a file named `Coverage.txt` and double-click it to open.

The `Coverage.txt` file contains the detailed output of the Git blame command for each file in your project. It shows the commit hash, author name, and the line of code responsible for that commit.

## Conclusion
Implementing Git blame in Swift projects enables you to easily track code authorship and enhance the collaboration and accountability within your development team. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can seamlessly integrate Git blame into your Swift project and leverage its benefits for efficient code management.
