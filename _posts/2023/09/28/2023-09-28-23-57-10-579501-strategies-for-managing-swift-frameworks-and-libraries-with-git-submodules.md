When developing iOS or macOS applications in Swift, you often need to include external frameworks or libraries to enhance your project's functionality. Git submodules can be a powerful tool for managing these dependencies effectively. In this article, we will explore some strategies for using Git submodules to manage Swift frameworks and libraries seamlessly.

## What are Git submodules?

Git submodules allow you to include other Git repositories within your own repository as a subdirectory. This enables you to keep the external code separate from your project, while still being able to track the versions and updates of the dependencies.

## Strategy 1: Using Git submodules for stable libraries

If you are using stable libraries or frameworks that rarely change, adding them as Git submodules can be a reliable approach. Here's how you can do it:

1. Identify the library or framework you want to include. Clone its repository using `git submodule add <repository-url>`.

2. Commit the changes by running `git commit -m "Added submodule: <submodule-name>"`.

3. Whenever there's a new release or update of the library, you can simply pull the latest changes by navigating to the submodule directory and running `git pull origin master`.

4. Commit the updated submodule to your main project repository to ensure your codebase includes the latest version of the library.

## Strategy 2: Using Git submodules for actively developed frameworks

In the case of actively developed frameworks or libraries, directly incorporating them as Git submodules might lead to several challenges. Here's an alternative strategy to overcome this:

1. Fork the library or framework repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone your forked repository and add it as a Git submodule to your main project repository.
3. Inside the submodule, you can make changes, improvements, or bug fixes specific to your project.
4. As you make changes in the submodule, you can commit and push them to your forked repository.
5. If your changes prove to be useful for the upstream project, you can create a pull request to contribute back.
6. Whenever there's an update in the upstream repository, you can fetch the changes and merge them into your submodule.

This strategy allows you to benefit from the active development of the framework while maintaining control over your specific modifications.

## Conclusion

Git submodules provide a convenient way to manage Swift frameworks and libraries within your project. Whether you are incorporating stable or actively developed dependencies, leveraging Git submodules with these strategies can streamline your development process and ensure your project remains organized and up-to-date with the latest versions.
