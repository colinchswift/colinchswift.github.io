In this tutorial, we will learn how to build a document scanning app using Swift in iOS. The app will utilize the device's camera to capture images of documents and then apply image processing techniques to enhance the quality of the scanned document.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your development machine:
- Xcode IDE
- Swift programming language

## Step 1: Setting up the Project
First, open Xcode and create a new iOS project. Choose the "Single View App" template and provide a suitable name for your project.

## Step 2: Adding Camera Access Permission
To allow the app to access the device's camera, we need to add the necessary permission in the app's `Info.plist` file. Open the `Info.plist` file and add the following key-value pair:

```
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to scan documents</string>
```

## Step 3: Designing the User Interface
Next, we need to design the user interface (UI) for our document scanning app. Open the project's storyboard file and add a `UIView` to serve as the camera preview area. You can also add other elements such as buttons for capturing and saving the scanned document.

## Step 4: Capturing Images
To capture images using the device's camera, we will utilize the `AVFoundation` framework. Create a new Swift file and name it `DocumentScanner.swift`. In this file, we will implement the code for initializing the camera session, capturing images, and displaying the preview on the designated `UIView` in the UI.

```swift
import AVFoundation
import UIKit

class DocumentScanner {
    private var captureSession: AVCaptureSession?
    private var capturePhotoOutput: AVCapturePhotoOutput?
    private var previewLayer: AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer?
    private var cameraPreviewView: UIView?

    func setupCameraSession(onPreviewView view: UIView) {
        // Initialize capture session, configure inputs and outputs
        // Add preview layer to the provided view
    }

    func startCameraSession() {
        // Start the camera session
    }

    func captureImage() {
        // Capture an image using AVCapturePhotoOutput
    }
}
```

## Step 5: Image Processing
Once we have captured the image, we can apply image processing techniques to enhance the quality of the scanned document. We can use libraries like Core Image or OpenCV to perform tasks like image cropping, rotation, and de-skewing.

## Step 6: Saving Scanned Documents
Finally, we need to implement the logic for saving the scanned documents. We can save the processed image to the device's photo library or provide options for exporting the scanned document to various file formats.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have learned the basic steps involved in building a document scanning app using Swift in iOS. We covered setting up the project, accessing the device's camera, designing the UI, capturing images, performing image processing, and saving the scanned documents.

Remember to test your app thoroughly in different scenarios and optimize the image processing algorithms as needed. With a fully functional document scanning app, users can conveniently digitize their paper documents using their iOS devices. Happy coding!
