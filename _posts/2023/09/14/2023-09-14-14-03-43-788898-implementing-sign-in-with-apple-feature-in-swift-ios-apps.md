Apple introduced the Sign-In with Apple feature to provide a secure and convenient way for users to sign in to apps and websites. This feature allows users to use their Apple ID to authenticate, without sharing their personal email address. In this tutorial, we will learn how to implement the Sign-In with Apple feature in Swift iOS apps.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you will need:
- Xcode installed on your Mac
- An Apple Developer account

## Step 1: Enable Sign-In with Apple Capability
To enable the Sign-In with Apple capability in your Xcode project, follow these steps:

1. Open your project in Xcode.
2. Go to the project settings by clicking on the project name in the project navigator.
3. Select your target and go to the **Signing & Capabilities** tab.
4. Click on the **+ Capability** button.
5. Search for **Sign In with Apple** and click on it to enable the capability.

## Step 2: Add Sign-In with Apple Button
To add a Sign-In with Apple button to your iOS app, follow these steps:

1. Open the storyboard or XIB file where you want to add the button.
2. Drag and drop a **Sign In With Apple Button** from the object library onto your view controller.
3. Customize the button's appearance and layout as desired.

## Step 3: Handle Sign-In with Apple Callback
To handle the callback after a user signs in with their Apple ID, you need to add the appropriate code in your view controller. Here's an example of how you can handle the sign-in callback:

```swift
import AuthenticationServices

class ViewController: UIViewController, ASAuthorizationControllerDelegate, ASAuthorizationControllerPresentationContextProviding {
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        let signInWithAppleButton = ASAuthorizationAppleIDButton()
        signInWithAppleButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(handleSignInWithAppleButtonTap), for: .touchUpInside)
        view.addSubview(signInWithAppleButton)
    }
    
    @objc func handleSignInWithAppleButtonTap() {
        let request = ASAuthorizationAppleIDProvider().createRequest()
        request.requestedScopes = [.fullName, .email]
        
        let controller = ASAuthorizationController(authorizationRequests: [request])
        controller.delegate = self
        controller.presentationContextProvider = self
        controller.performRequests()
    }
    
    // Handle authorization completion
    func authorizationController(controller: ASAuthorizationController, didCompleteWithAuthorization authorization: ASAuthorization) {
        if let credential = authorization.credential as? ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential {
            let userIdentifier = credential.user
            let fullName = credential.fullName
            let email = credential.email
            
            // Process user data
        }
    }
    
    // Handle authorization failure
    func authorizationController(controller: ASAuthorizationController, didCompleteWithError error: Error) {
        // Handle error
    }
    
    // Provide presentation context for authorization controller
    func presentationAnchor(for controller: ASAuthorizationController) -> ASPresentationAnchor {
        return self.view.window!
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can easily implement the Sign-In with Apple feature in your Swift iOS app. This feature offers a convenient and secure way for users to sign in and provides them with more control over their privacy. Make sure to handle the callbacks appropriately and process the user data as required.
