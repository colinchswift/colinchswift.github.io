Are you tired of the default keyboard on your iOS device? Do you want to give your users a unique typing experience in your app? In this tutorial, we will guide you on how to create your own custom keyboard using Swift.

## Step 1: Create a New Keyboard Target

To start, open Xcode and create a new project. Choose "iOS" and select "Keyboard Extension" as the project template.

## Step 2: Design the Keyboard Interface

Once the project is created, you will see the newly added KeyboardViewController.swift file. Open it and locate the "viewDidLoad" method. This is where we will design the keyboard interface.

You can use the `UIStackView` and `UIButton` objects to create the layout for your custom keyboard. Here's an example:

```swift
func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    
    let keyboardStackView = UIStackView()
    keyboardStackView.axis = .vertical
    keyboardStackView.alignment = .fill
    keyboardStackView.distribution = .fillEqually
    
    let row1StackView = UIStackView()
    row1StackView.axis = .horizontal
    row1StackView.alignment = .fill
    row1StackView.distribution = .fillEqually
    
    let button1 = UIButton(type: .system)
    // Custom button styling and functionality
    
    // Add more buttons and stack views for the remaining rows
    
    row1StackView.addArrangedSubview(button1)
    // Add more buttons to the respective row stack views
    
    keyboardStackView.addArrangedSubview(row1StackView)
    // Add more row stack views to the main keyboard stack view
    
    self.view.addSubview(keyboardStackView)
}
```

## Step 3: Handle Button Actions

Now that you have designed the keyboard interface, it's time to handle the button actions. In the same KeyboardViewController.swift file, add a method to handle button taps:

```swift
@objc func buttonTapped(sender: UIButton) {
    let title = sender.titleLabel?.text
    // Handle button tap based on the title
    
    // For example, you can insert the button title into the text document proxy
    textDocumentProxy.insertText(title ?? "")
}
```

Next, add a target to each button in your `viewDidLoad` method:

```swift
button1.addTarget(self, action: #selector(buttonTapped), for: .touchUpInside)
```

## Step 4: Build and Run

Finally, build and run your custom keyboard on a connected device or simulator. To test it, go to Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards > Add New Keyboard, and select your custom keyboard from the list.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully created a custom keyboard using Swift for iOS. You can now explore further customization options, such as adding more buttons, handling special characters, or implementing gestures. Remember to keep user experience and functionality in mind while designing your custom keyboard.
