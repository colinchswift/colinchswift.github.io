With the increasing focus on health and fitness, building a fitness tracking app can be a great idea to enter the app development field. In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of building a fitness tracking app using Swift in iOS. Let's get started!

## Requirements

To build the fitness tracking app, we need the following:

1. Xcode - the integrated development environment for iOS app development.
2. Swift - the programming language used to build iOS apps.
3. CoreMotion framework - to access the device's built-in sensors and track motion.

## Getting Started

1. Open Xcode and create a new project. Select "Single View App" as the template.

2. Add the necessary permissions in the `info.plist` file to access the device's motion data. Add the following key-value pairs:

   ```
   <key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your motion data to track your fitness activities.</string>
   ```

3. Create a new Swift file named `FitnessTracker.swift`. This file will contain the logic for tracking and calculating fitness data.

4. Inside the `FitnessTracker.swift` file, import the CoreMotion framework:

   ```swift
   import CoreMotion
   ```

5. Create an instance of the `CMMotionActivityManager` class to begin receiving motion updates:

   ```swift
   let motionActivityManager = CMMotionActivityManager()
   ```

6. Request authorization to access motion data from the user:

   ```swift
   func requestMotionAuthorization() {
       if CMMotionActivityManager.isActivityAvailable() {
           motionActivityManager.requestActivityAuthorization { (status) in
               // Handle authorization status
           }
       } else {
           // Motion activity is not available on this device
       }
   }
   ```

7. Implement the necessary methods to start and stop motion updates:

   ```swift
   func startTrackingMotion() {
       motionActivityManager.startActivityUpdates(to: OperationQueue.main) { (motionActivity) in
           // Handle motion activity updates
       }
   }
   
   func stopTrackingMotion() {
       motionActivityManager.stopActivityUpdates()
   }
   ```

8. Implement the logic to calculate fitness data based on the received motion updates:

   ```swift
   func calculateFitnessData(from motionActivity: CMMotionActivity) {
       // Logic for calculating fitness data
   }
   ```

9. Use the `motionActivity` parameter passed in the `startActivityUpdates` closure to access the motion data and calculate fitness metrics.

10. Integrate the `FitnessTracker` logic into your app's UI to display and track fitness data.

Congratulations! You have successfully built a fitness tracking app using Swift in iOS. The app can now track the user's motion and calculate fitness metrics based on the received data.

Remember to optimize your app for performance and provide a user-friendly interface to enhance the user experience. Keep exploring different features and possibilities to make your fitness tracking app stand out in the competitive market.
