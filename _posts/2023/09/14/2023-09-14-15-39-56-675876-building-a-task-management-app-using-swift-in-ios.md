In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of building a task management app using Swift in iOS. This app will allow users to create, edit, and manage their tasks efficiently. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need:

- Xcode installed on your Mac
- Basic knowledge of Swift programming language

## Step 1: Create a New Project

1. Open Xcode and click on "Create a new Xcode project".
2. Select "iOS" under the "Application" category.
3. Choose "Single View App" template.
4. Enter a name for your project and select a team if necessary.
5. Choose a directory to save your project and click on "Create".
6. Xcode will create a new project with a single view controller.

## Step 2: Design User Interface

1. Open the `Main.storyboard` file.
2. Drag and drop a `UITableView` from the Object Library onto the view controller.
3. Adjust the size and position of the table view to fit the screen.
4. Add a `UITableViewCell` to the table view.
5. Customize the cell by adding labels and buttons for displaying task details.
6. Create an outlet for the table view in the view controller class.

## Step 3: Create a Data Model

1. Create a new Swift file called `Task.swift`.
2. Define a `Task` class with properties such as title, description, due date, and status.
3. Implement the required initializers and methods for the `Task` class.

```swift
class Task {
    var title: String
    var description: String
    var dueDate: Date?
    var isCompleted: Bool
    
    init(title: String, description: String) {
        self.title = title
        self.description = description
        self.isCompleted = false
    }
    
    // Additional methods for managing tasks
}
```

## Step 4: Implement Task List View

1. Open the View Controller class.
2. Create an array to store tasks: 

```swift
var tasks: [Task] = []
```

3. Override the `viewDidLoad()` method and populate the `tasks` array with dummy data for testing.
4. Implement the required data source methods for the table view, such as `numberOfRowsInSection` and `cellForRowAt`.
5. Customize each cell in the `cellForRowAt` method with task details.

## Step 5: Add Task Creation Functionality

1. Create a new view controller for task creation.
2. Design the user interface for adding a new task, including text fields and buttons.
3. Implement the necessary functionality in the task creation view controller to create a new task.
4. Pass the newly created task back to the task list view controller.
5. Add a segue from the task list view controller to the task creation view controller.

## Step 6: Add Task Editing Functionality

1. Create a new view controller for task editing.
2. Design the user interface for editing a task, including pre-filled text fields and buttons.
3. Implement the necessary functionality in the task editing view controller to update a task.
4. Pass the updated task back to the task list view controller.
5. Add a segue from the task list view controller to the task editing view controller.

## Step 7: Add Task Deletion Functionality

1. Implement the `commit editingStyle` method for the table view in the task list view controller.
2. Delete the selected task from the tasks array and update the table view.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully built a task management app using Swift in iOS. This app allows users to create, edit, and manage their tasks seamlessly. Feel free to enhance the app further by adding additional features such as task prioritization and reminders.
