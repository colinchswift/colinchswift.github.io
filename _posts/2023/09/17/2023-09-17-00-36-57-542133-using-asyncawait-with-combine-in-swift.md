Combine is a powerful framework introduced by Apple to work with asynchronous events and data streams in Swift. With the release of Swift 5.5, Apple introduced `async/await`, a new language feature that simplifies working with asynchronous code. In this blog post, we'll see how to combine `async/await` with Combine to create cleaner and more readable asynchronous code.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with the code examples in this post, you'll need:

- Xcode 13 or later
- Swift 5.5 or later

## What is `async/await`?

`async/await` is a new way of writing asynchronous code in Swift. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code, making it easier to read, write, and reason about. With `async/await`, you can write functions that suspend their execution until a result is available, without blocking the main thread.

## Combining `async/await` with Combine

Combine provides a set of operators and types for working with asynchronous events and data streams. You can easily combine `async/await` with Combine to handle asynchronous operations and transform data streams.

Here's an example of using `async/await` with Combine to fetch data from a remote API:

```swift
import Combine

struct Article {
    let title: String
    let author: String
    let content: String
}

func fetchArticles() async throws -> [Article] {
    let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/articles")!
    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
    let articles = try JSONDecoder().decode([Article].self, from: data)
    return articles
}

async {
    do {
        let articles = try await fetchArticles()
        articles.forEach { article in
            print(article.title)
        }
    } catch {
        print("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```

In the above code, we define a `fetchArticles` function that uses `async/await` to perform a network request asynchronously. We await the response from `URLSession.shared.data(from:)` and decode it using `JSONDecoder`. Finally, we return the decoded articles.

We can then call this `fetchArticles` function using `await` within an `async` block to fetch and print the article titles.

## Conclusion

Using `async/await` with Combine in Swift allows us to write cleaner and more readable asynchronous code. It simplifies working with asynchronous operations and data streams, making our code more maintainable and easier to reason about. If you haven't already, give `async/await` and Combine a try in your Swift projects!
