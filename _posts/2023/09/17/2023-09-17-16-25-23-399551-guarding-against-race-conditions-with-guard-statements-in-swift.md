Race conditions are a common problem in multi-threaded programming, where multiple threads access shared resources simultaneously, potentially leading to unpredictable and incorrect results. Swift provides a powerful tool called guard statements that can help mitigate the risk of race conditions.

Guard statements enable us to check certain conditions and exit early if they are not met. This can help ensure that only one thread at a time accesses and modifies shared resources, avoiding race conditions.

Here's an example of how to use guard statements to guard against race conditions in Swift:

```swift
import Foundation

class SharedResource {
    private var value: Int = 0
    private let lock = NSLock()
    
    func updateValue() {
        guard lock.tryLock() else {
            return // Exit early if lock cannot be acquired
        }
        
        // Critical section: Access and modify shared resource
        value += 1
        
        lock.unlock()
    }
}
```

In the above example, we have a `SharedResource` class that contains a private variable `value` and a lock object `lock` from the `NSLock` class. The `updateValue()` method is the critical section where the shared resource `value` is accessed and modified.

By using the `guard` statement with `lock.tryLock()`, we try to acquire the lock before entering the critical section. If the lock is unable to be acquired (indicating that another thread is already accessing the shared resource), the guard statement allows us to exit early from the method, preventing any further modification of the shared resource.

Once the lock is acquired, we can safely access and modify the shared resource `value`. Finally, we release the lock by calling `unlock()`.

By utilizing guard statements with appropriate locks, we can effectively guard against race conditions in multi-threaded Swift code.
