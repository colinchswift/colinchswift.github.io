Error handling is an essential aspect of app development as it allows us to handle unexpected runtime errors gracefully. In Swift, there are several ways to tackle error handling, but in this blog post, we'll explore a functional approach using Result types and guard statements.

## Introduction to Result types

Swift 5 introduced `Result` type, which is an enum with two cases: `success` and `failure`. It is used to represent the result of an operation that can either succeed with a value or fail with an error.

Here's the definition of the `Result` type:

```swift
enum Result<Success, Failure: Error> {
    case success(Success)
    case failure(Failure)
}
```

## Guard statements

Guard statements are a concise way to handle conditions that, if not met, should exit the current scope. They are particularly useful when it comes to error handling.

A guard statement has the following syntax:

```swift
guard condition else {
    // Error handling code
    return
}
```

## Using Result types and guard statements together

Let's see how we can combine Result types and guard statements to handle errors in a functional way. Consider a function that divides two integers and returns the result:

```swift
func divide(a: Int, b: Int) -> Result<Int, Error> {
    guard b != 0 else {
        return Result.failure(MyError("Cannot divide by zero"))
    }
    
    let result = a / b
    return Result.success(result)
}
```

In the above code, we use a guard statement to check if the divisor (`b`) is not zero. If it is zero, we return a `Result.failure` with a custom error.

Now, let's use this function and handle the result:

```swift
let result = divide(a: 10, b: 2)

switch result {
case .success(let quotient):
    print("Quotient: \(quotient)")
case .failure(let error):
    print("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

In the example above, we use a switch statement to handle the result of the `divide` function. If the result is `.success`, we print the quotient. If it's `.failure`, we print the error description.

By using Result types and guard statements together, we can write error handling code in a more expressive and functional manner. This approach helps us deal with errors as values, making our code more readable and maintainable.
