Empty collections can lead to unexpected crashes or errors when not handled properly. In Swift, one way to ensure that collections are not empty is by using `guard` statements. `guard` statements help you gracefully handle the case where a collection is empty by exiting the current scope early and providing error handling or a fallback option.

Let's explore how to guard against empty collections using `guard` statements in Swift.

## 1. Using `guard` statement to check for an empty array

```swift
func processArray(_ array: [Int]) {
    guard !array.isEmpty else {
        print("Error: Array is empty")
        return
    }
    
    // Array is not empty, perform the necessary computations
    // and operations here
    // ...
}
```

In the example above, we define a function `processArray` that takes an array of type `Int` as a parameter. The `guard` statement checks if the array is empty by using the `isEmpty` property of the array. If the array is empty, an error message is printed and the function returns early. If the array is not empty, the code inside the `guard` statement block continues execution.

## 2. Using `guard` statement to check for an empty dictionary

```swift
func processDictionary(_ dictionary: [String: Any]) {
    guard !dictionary.isEmpty else {
        print("Error: Dictionary is empty")
        return
    }
    
    // Dictionary is not empty, perform the necessary computations
    // and operations here
    // ...
}
```

In the example above, we define a function `processDictionary` that takes a dictionary of type `[String: Any]` as a parameter. The `guard` statement checks if the dictionary is empty by using the `isEmpty` property of the dictionary. If the dictionary is empty, an error message is printed and the function returns early. If the dictionary is not empty, the code inside the `guard` statement block continues execution.

## Conclusion

Using `guard` statements is an effective way to guard against empty collections in Swift. By checking for empty arrays or dictionaries, you can handle such cases gracefully and avoid unexpected crashes or errors in your code. Remember to use `guard` statements whenever you expect a collection to have at least one element. This will improve the robustness and reliability of your code.
