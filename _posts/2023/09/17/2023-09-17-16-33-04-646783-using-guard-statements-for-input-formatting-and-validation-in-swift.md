Input formatting and validation are important aspects of developing robust and reliable applications. In Swift, one approach to handle these tasks is by using guard statements. Guard statements provide a clean and concise way to validate inputs and exit early if necessary.

## Input Formatting

Let's start with input formatting, which involves ensuring that the provided input adheres to a specific format or structure. Whether it's a phone number, email address, or date, we can use guard statements to check if the input matches the desired format.

For example, imagine we need to validate an email address. We can define a function that takes an email string as an argument and use a guard statement to check if it matches the expected format:

```swift
func validateEmail(email: String) -> Bool {
    guard let regex = try? NSRegularExpression(pattern:
        "[A-Z0-9a-z._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Za-z]{2,}",
        options: .caseInsensitive
    ) else {
        return false
    }
    
    let matches = regex.matches(
        in: email,
        options: [],
        range: NSRange(location: 0, length: email.count)
    )
    
    return matches.count == 1
}
```

In this example, we used a regular expression pattern to define the expected email format. The guard statement checks if the input matches this pattern, and if not, it returns false. Otherwise, it continues with the execution of the function.

## Input Validation

Input validation goes beyond formatting and involves checking if the input meets certain criteria or constraints. For example, if we have a function that calculates the area of a rectangle, we can use a guard statement to ensure that the provided width and height values are positive.

```swift
func calculateRectangleArea(width: Double, height: Double) -> Double? {
    guard width > 0 && height > 0 else {
        return nil
    }
    
    return width * height
}
```

In this case, if either the width or height is not greater than 0, the guard statement will return nil, indicating that the inputs are invalid.

By using guard statements for input validation, we can effectively handle unexpected or invalid inputs, improving the overall reliability and stability of our code.

## Benefits of Using Guard Statements

Using guard statements for input formatting and validation offers several advantages:

- **Early exit:** Guard statements provide a clear and early exit from a function or method if the input does not meet the desired criteria. This simplifies the code and avoids unnecessary execution of invalid or faulty logic.
- **Readability:** By using guard statements, the intent of the code is clear and easy to understand. It eliminates the need for nested if statements and reduces complexity.
- **Error handling:** Guard statements provide an opportunity to handle errors or invalid inputs appropriately. Instead of silently failing or crashing, we can gracefully handle invalid inputs and inform the user or developer about the issue.

In conclusion, guard statements in Swift are powerful tools for input formatting and validation. By using them effectively, we can enhance the reliability, readability, and overall user experience of our applications.
