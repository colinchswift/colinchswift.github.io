When working with Swift, it's important to handle errors gracefully. Swift provides powerful error handling mechanisms, including custom error types and guard statements. In this article, we will explore how to implement custom error types and use guard statements to safely handle errors in your Swift code.

## Custom Error Types

Custom error types allow you to define your own error types specific to your application's requirements. This can make error handling more expressive and allow you to provide more meaningful error messages to the user.

To define a custom error type, you need to create a new `enum` that conforms to the `Error` protocol. Each case of the `enum` represents a different error scenario. You can include additional properties or associated values to provide more context to the error. Here's an example:

```swift
enum NetworkError: Error {
    case invalidURL
    case serverError(statusCode: Int)
    case requestTimeout
}
```

In the example above, we define a custom error type named `NetworkError`. It has three cases: `invalidURL`, `serverError`, and `requestTimeout`. The `serverError` case includes an associated value of type `Int` to represent the HTTP status code.

## Handling Errors with Guard Statements

Guard statements are a powerful tool in Swift to handle errors and ensure proper flow in your code. They allow you to check conditions and exit early if the conditions are not met, commonly used for input validation and error handling.

When a guard statement encounters an error condition, it throws an error. The error can be caught and handled using a `do-catch` block, or allowed to propagate up the call stack.

Let's see an example of how to use guard statements to handle errors:

```swift
func fetchData(from url: URL) throws -> Data {
    guard let data = try? Data(contentsOf: url) else {
        throw NetworkError.invalidURL
    }
    
    guard let statusCode = (response as? HTTPURLResponse)?.statusCode,
          200..<300 ~= statusCode else {
        throw NetworkError.serverError(statusCode: statusCode)
    }
    
    return data
}
```

In the above example, the `fetchData` function uses guard statements to handle errors. It checks if the URL is valid using `guard let`, and throws the `NetworkError.invalidURL` error if it's not.

Next, it checks the HTTP status code of the response to ensure it's within the success range (200-299). If not, it throws the `NetworkError.serverError` error with the corresponding status code.

## Conclusion

Custom error types and guard statements are powerful tools in Swift for handling errors and ensuring the robustness of your code. By defining custom error types, you can provide more meaningful error messages and context to the user. Using guard statements, you can validate inputs and handle errors gracefully, leading to more reliable and maintainable code.
