When programming in Swift, guard statements can be a powerful tool for checking conditions and ensuring code safety. However, there are a few common mistakes that developers often make when using guard statements. In this article, we will discuss these mistakes and provide tips on how to avoid them.

## Mistake #1: Neglecting the Early Return

One common mistake is neglecting to include an early return statement after the guard statement fails. The purpose of a guard statement is to exit the current scope if a condition is not met. Without an early return, the code will continue executing, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

To avoid this mistake, **always include an early return statement** immediately after the guard statement. By doing so, you ensure that the rest of the code is skipped if the condition is not met.

```swift
func doSomething(with value: Int) {
    guard value > 0 else {
        return // Early return here
    }
    
    // Rest of the code
}
```

## Mistake #2: Neglecting to Provide Relevant Error Messages

Another mistake often made is neglecting to provide meaningful error messages in the guard statement. When a guard condition fails, it's important to provide feedback to assist with debugging.

To avoid this mistake, **always provide a descriptive error message** inside the guard statement. This message typically explains why the condition failed, making it easier for developers to identify and fix the issue.

```swift
func validate(username: String?) {
    guard let username = username else {
        fatalError("Username cannot be nil!") // Descriptive error message
    }
    
    // Rest of the code
}
```

## Conclusion

Guard statements are a powerful tool in Swift, but they should be used correctly to avoid common mistakes. By remembering to include an early return statement and providing relevant error messages, you can ensure that your code is more robust and easier to maintain.
