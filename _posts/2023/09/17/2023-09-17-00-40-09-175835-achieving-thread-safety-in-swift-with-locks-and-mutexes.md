Thread safety is an essential concept in multi-threaded programming. It ensures that shared resources and data structures can be accessed concurrently by multiple threads without causing unexpected behaviors or data corruption. In Swift, achieving thread safety can be done using locks and mutexes. Let's explore how to achieve thread safety in Swift with locks and mutexes.

## Locks
A lock is a synchronization mechanism that ensures only one thread can access a critical section of code at a time. In Swift, we can use the `os_unfair_lock` from the `os` module to implement locks. Here's an example:

```swift
import os

class ThreadSafeClass {
    private var resource: String = ""
    private var lock = os_unfair_lock()

    func updateResource(value: String) {
        os_unfair_lock_lock(&lock)
        resource = value
        os_unfair_lock_unlock(&lock)
    }
    
    func readResource() -> String {
        os_unfair_lock_lock(&lock)
        let copy = resource
        os_unfair_lock_unlock(&lock)
        return copy
    }
}
```
In this example, we use `os_unfair_lock` to protect the `resource` property within `ThreadSafeClass`. The `updateResource` method locks the `resource` using `os_unfair_lock_lock()` before updating its value, and unlocks it using `os_unfair_lock_unlock()` after the update. The `readResource` method follows the same approach to read the value of the `resource` property.

## Mutexes
A mutex (short for "mutual exclusion") is another synchronization primitive that ensures exclusive access to shared resources. In Swift, we can use `pthread_mutex` from the `pthread` module to implement mutexes. Here's an example:

```swift
import pthread

class ThreadSafeClass {
    private var resource: String = ""
    private var mutex = pthread_mutex_t()

    init() {
        pthread_mutex_init(&mutex, nil)
    }
    
    deinit {
        pthread_mutex_destroy(&mutex)
    }

    func updateResource(value: String) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex)
        resource = value
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex)
    }
    
    func readResource() -> String {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex)
        let copy = resource
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex)
        return copy
    }
}
```
In this example, we use `pthread_mutex` to protect the `resource` property within `ThreadSafeClass`. The `updateResource` method locks the `mutex` using `pthread_mutex_lock()` before updating the `resource` value, and unlocks it using `pthread_mutex_unlock()` afterward. The `readResource` method follows the same approach to read the value of the `resource` property.

## Conclusion
Achieving thread safety is crucial in multi-threaded Swift applications to prevent data corruption and unexpected behavior. In this post, we explored using locks and mutexes to ensure thread safety. The `os_unfair_lock` and `pthread_mutex` provide reliable mechanisms to synchronize access to shared resources or critical sections of code. By implementing these techniques, you can ensure the integrity of your data and the reliability of your multi-threaded Swift application.
