Guards in Swift are an important construct that allows you to check for certain conditions and exit early if they are not met. While Swift provides a set of built-in guard conditions, sometimes you may need to create your own custom guard conditions to suit the specific requirements of your application. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement custom guards in Swift.

## Why Use Custom Guards?

Custom guards can be useful in scenarios where you want to perform a set of condition checks that are specific to your application logic. By creating custom guards, you can enhance code readability, reduce nesting, and make your code more expressive.

## Implementing Custom Guards

To implement a custom guard in Swift, you need to define a function that takes a condition as a parameter and returns a `Bool` indicating whether the guard condition is met or not. Let's look at an example:

```swift
func isEven(_ number: Int) -> Bool {
    return number % 2 == 0
}

func guardEvenNumber(_ number: Int) {
    guard isEven(number) else {
        fatalError("Invalid input: \(number) is not an even number.")
    }

    // Continue with the rest of your code if the guard condition is met
    // ...
}
```

In the above example, we have defined a `guardEvenNumber` function that checks if a number is even using the `isEven` function. If the condition is not met, it uses `fatalError` to terminate the program with an error message.

To use this custom guard, simply call the `guardEvenNumber` function with the number you want to check:

```swift
guardEvenNumber(10) // No error, as 10 is an even number
guardEvenNumber(7) // Error: Invalid input: 7 is not an even number.
```

## Benefits of Custom Guards

Implementing custom guards in Swift brings several benefits:

1. **Improved Readability**: Custom guards make your code more readable by encapsulating complex condition checks and providing meaningful function names.
2. **Reduced Nesting**: Custom guards allow you to break out of nested conditionals, reducing the level of indentation and making your code more concise.
3. **Code Reusability**: By creating custom guards, you can reuse them throughout your codebase whenever you need to perform the same condition checks.

## Conclusion

Custom guards in Swift are a powerful tool for enhancing the readability and expressiveness of your code. By implementing custom guards, you can encapsulate complex condition checks, reduce code nesting, and improve code reuse. Start using custom guards in your Swift projects to write cleaner and more maintainable code.
