In Swift, guard statements are a powerful tool for input validation and early exit from a function. While they are mainly used for checking conditions and ensuring correct input, they can also be utilized for input normalization and transformation.

## Input Normalization

Input normalization is the process of converting input data into a consistent and standardized format. It can involve removing unnecessary characters, converting case, or applying any other type of data manipulation. Guard statements can help in performing input normalization effectively.

Let's say you have a function that accepts a string parameter which should be in uppercase. To normalize the input, you can use a guard statement to check if the input is lowercase or mixed case, and then convert it to uppercase using the `uppercased()` method:

```swift
func processInput(_ input: String) {
    guard input == input.uppercased() else {
        let normalizedInput = input.uppercased()
        // Perform further processing with normalizedInput
        return
    }
    // Rest of the code when input is already in uppercase
}
```

In this example, the guard statement checks if the input string is equal to its uppercase version. If they are not equal, it means the input is not in uppercase and needs to be normalized. The `uppercased()` method is then used to convert the input to uppercase, and further processing can be performed with the normalized input.

## Input Transformation

Input transformation involves modifying or converting the input data to a different representation or format. Guard statements can be used to perform input transformation based on certain conditions.

Let's consider a scenario where you have a function that takes an integer parameter, but you need to restrict the input to positive values only. You can use a guard statement to check if the input is negative and transform it to a positive value:

```swift
func processInput(_ input: Int) {
    guard input >= 0 else {
        let transformedInput = input * -1
        // Perform further processing with transformedInput
        return
    }
    // Rest of the code when input is already positive
}
```

In this example, the guard statement checks if the input is less than 0, indicating a negative value. If the condition is true, the input is transformed by multiplying it with -1 to make it positive. Further processing can then be performed with the transformed input.

## Conclusion

Guard statements in Swift are not limited to input validation alone. They can also be utilized for input normalization and transformation, making them a versatile tool in handling different types of input. By using guard statements effectively, you can ensure that your functions receive the expected input format or convert them to the desired format for seamless execution.
