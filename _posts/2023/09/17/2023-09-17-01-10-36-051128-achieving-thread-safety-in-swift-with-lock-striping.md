One of the challenges in multi-threaded programming is ensuring thread safety and avoiding race conditions. In Swift, thread safety can be achieved through various techniques, one of which is **lock striping**.

Lock striping is a concurrency technique that partitions the data into multiple locks, reducing contention and allowing multiple threads to access different parts of the data concurrently. This technique is useful when the data structure is very large or when the access patterns are widely distributed.

In Swift, we can implement lock striping using the `os_unfair_lock` from the `os` module. Here's an example implementation of a thread-safe counter using lock striping:

```swift
import os.lock

class StripedCounter {
    private let lockCount = 16 // Number of locks
    private var locks: [os_unfair_lock_t]
    private var counts: [Int]

    init() {
        locks = [os_unfair_lock_t](repeating: os_unfair_lock_t(), count: lockCount)
        counts = [Int](repeating: 0, count: lockCount)

        for i in 0..<lockCount {
            locks[i] = os_unfair_lock_t()
        }
    }

    func increment() {
        let key = Int.random(in: 0..<lockCount)
        os_unfair_lock_lock(&locks[key])
        counts[key] += 1
        os_unfair_lock_unlock(&locks[key])
    }

    func getCount() -> Int {
        var total = 0

        for i in 0..<lockCount {
            os_unfair_lock_lock(&locks[i])
            total += counts[i]
            os_unfair_lock_unlock(&locks[i])
        }

        return total
    }
}
```

In this example, we create an array of locks (`locks`) and an array to track the counts (`counts`). The number of locks can be adjusted depending on your use case and the expected concurrency.

In the `increment()` method, we generate a random key within the range of lock indices and lock the specific lock associated with that key. We then increment the count at that index and unlock the lock.

The `getCount()` method iterates over all the locks, locking each one, and accumulating the counts. It then returns the total count.

By using lock striping, different threads can increment and read the counts concurrently without contention, thus achieving thread safety. However, it's worth noting that lock striping is not a silver bullet and may not be suitable for all scenarios. It's important to carefully consider the requirements and characteristics of your application before adopting any concurrency technique.
