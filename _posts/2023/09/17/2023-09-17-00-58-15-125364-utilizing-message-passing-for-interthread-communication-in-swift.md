In multi-threaded programming, it is essential to have a mechanism for threads to communicate and synchronize with each other. **Message passing** is a popular approach to achieve this in Swift. By passing messages between threads, developers can share data, request actions, and coordinate the execution of tasks.

## What is Message Passing?

Message passing is an interthread communication technique where threads send and receive messages to exchange information. In Swift, this can be achieved through different mechanisms, including `NotificationCenter`, `DispatchQueue`, and custom messaging systems.

## Using NotificationCenter for Message Passing

The `NotificationCenter` class in Swift provides a convenient way to implement message passing among threads. Here's an example of how to use `NotificationCenter` for interthread communication:

```swift
// Register for notification
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(forName: Notification.Name("DataAvailableNotification"), object: nil, queue: nil) { (notification) in
    // Process received data
    if let userInfo = notification.userInfo {
        if let data = userInfo["data"] as? String {
            print("Received data: \(data)")
        }
    }
}

// Send notification
let data = "Sample Data"
let userInfo = ["data": data]
NotificationCenter.default.post(name: Notification.Name("DataAvailableNotification"), object: nil, userInfo: userInfo)
```

In this example, one thread registers for a specific notification using `addObserver`. Another thread can then send a notification using `post` to notify all registered observers about the availability of data.

## Using DispatchQueue for Message Passing

Another way to achieve interthread communication is by utilizing `DispatchQueue`. By creating custom dispatch queues, threads can submit work items asynchronously or synchronously, effectively passing messages between them.

```swift
// Create custom DispatchQueue
let customQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.example.customQueue")

// Submit work item to customQueue
customQueue.async {
    let data = "Sample Data"
    print("Received data: \(data)")
}

// Perform synchronous work item submission
customQueue.sync {
    let data = "Sample Data"
    print("Received data: \(data)")
}
```

In this example, a custom dispatch queue is created. Work items can be submitted to this queue either asynchronously using `async` or synchronously using `sync`. The blocks of code inside these work items can process the received data accordingly.

## Conclusion

Interthread communication is crucial for developing efficient and synchronized multi-threaded applications. Swift provides various options for message passing, including `NotificationCenter` for broadcasting and observing notifications, and `DispatchQueue` for custom work item submission. Understanding these techniques can greatly enhance your ability to build robust and responsive multi-threaded applications in Swift.
