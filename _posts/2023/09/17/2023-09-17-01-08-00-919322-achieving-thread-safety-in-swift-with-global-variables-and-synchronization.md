Thread safety is an important aspect of concurrent programming, ensuring that multiple threads can safely access and modify shared data without causing unexpected behavior or data corruption. In Swift, achieving thread safety can be done using global variables and synchronization techniques.

## Global Variables in Swift

Global variables are declared outside of any function, class, or structure and can be accessed from anywhere within the module. They are commonly used for managing shared data across different parts of an application.

```swift
var sharedData: String = "Initial value"
```

In concurrent programming, if multiple threads try to access and modify the `sharedData` variable simultaneously, it can lead to race conditions and unexpected outcomes. To prevent this, we need to implement synchronization mechanisms.

## Synchronization Techniques

Synchronization techniques ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time, preventing race conditions. In Swift, the most commonly used synchronization technique is **locking**.

### Locking with `NSLock`

Swift provides the `NSLock` class to create locks that can be used for synchronization. Here's an example of how to use `NSLock` to achieve thread safety with global variables:

```swift
var lock = NSLock()

func updateSharedData(newValue: String) {
    lock.lock()
    sharedData = newValue
    lock.unlock()
}
```

In the example above, we create an `NSLock` instance `lock` and use its `lock()` and `unlock()` methods to acquire and release the lock, respectively. This ensures that only one thread can modify `sharedData` at a time.

### Locking with `DispatchQueue`

Another approach to achieve thread safety is by using `DispatchQueue` with a serial queue. A serial queue guarantees that only one task can be executed at a time, eliminating the need to manually manage locks.

```swift
let serialQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.example.serialQueue")

func updateSharedData(newValue: String) {
    serialQueue.sync {
        sharedData = newValue
    }
}
```

In the above example, we create a serial queue using `DispatchQueue` and use its `sync` method to execute the closure, which updates the `sharedData` variable. The `sync` method ensures that the closure is executed synchronously, guaranteeing thread safety.

## Conclusion

Achieving thread safety in Swift is crucial when dealing with shared data in concurrent programming scenarios. By using global variables and appropriate synchronization techniques like locking with `NSLock` or using a serial queue with `DispatchQueue`, we can ensure that multiple threads can safely access and modify shared data without causing race conditions or data corruption.

Remember, threading and concurrency can be complex areas of programming, so always carefully analyze and design your concurrent code to ensure thread safety. #Swift #ThreadSafety
