In multithreaded programming, it's essential to ensure thread safety to prevent data races and unexpected behavior. One way to achieve thread safety in Swift is by using guard statements. Guard statements help us validate conditions and exit early, which is particularly useful in ensuring data consistency in concurrent code.

Here's an example of how to use guard statements for thread safety in Swift:

```swift
class ThreadSafeArray<T> {
    private var array = [T]()
    private let queue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.example.threadSafeArray", attributes: .concurrent)

    func append(_ element: T) {
        queue.async(flags: .barrier) {
            self.array.append(element)
        }
    }

    func count() -> Int {
        var count = 0
        queue.sync {
            count = self.array.count
        }
        return count
    }

    func element(at index: Int) -> T? {
        var result: T?
        queue.sync {
            guard index >= 0, index < self.array.count else { return }
            result = self.array[index]
        }
        return result
    }
}
```

In the above example, we have created a `ThreadSafeArray` class that internally uses a regular array for storage. The `queue` property is an instance of `DispatchQueue` with the `.concurrent` attribute, allowing multiple threads to perform read operations concurrently.

The `append` method uses a *write barrier* by asynchronously dispatching a closure to the queue. This ensures that write operations are performed exclusively, preventing multiple threads from accessing the array simultaneously.

The `count` method demonstrates a *read barrier* by synchronously dispatching a closure to the queue. This guarantees that only one thread can access the `array` property at a time, providing a consistent count.

The `element(at index: Int)` method also uses a read barrier, but additionally, it employs a guard statement to validate the index. If the index is out of bounds, the guard statement will exit early, preventing any further code execution.

By utilizing guard statements within the context of concurrent queues, we can ensure thread safety and prevent data corruption or undefined behavior.

Remember to handle any errors appropriately when working with concurrent code to promote robustness and reliability in your applications.
