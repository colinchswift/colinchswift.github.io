Handling user interface events in Swift can sometimes lead to nested `if-let` statements, making the code harder to read and maintain. However, by leveraging guard statements, you can write cleaner and more concise code for handling UI events.

## What are guard statements?

In Swift, `guard` statements provide a way to exit a block of code early based on a certain condition. If the condition is not satisfied, the `guard` statement will execute the else block and exit the current scope.

## Why use guard statements for handling UI events?

1. **Early exit**: With `guard` statements, you can exit early from a function or closure if a condition is not met, avoiding unnecessary nested code blocks.
2. **Clarity**: By using `guard` statements, you can emphasize the conditions that need to be met for the code to continue executing.
3. **Reduce nesting**: Traditional `if-let` statements can lead to nested code blocks, making the code harder to read and understand. `Guard` statements allow you to structure your code more cleanly.

## Example usage

Let's assume you're handling a button tap event and you want to access the selected index of a UITableView if it exists. Here's how you can use a guard statement to handle this scenario:

```swift
@IBAction func buttonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
    guard let indexPath = tableView.indexPathForSelectedRow else {
        return
    }
    
    // Code to execute when indexPath is valid
    // ...
}
```

In the example above:

1. We start by using the guard statement to unwrap the optional value `indexPath` using `tableView.indexPathForSelectedRow`. If `indexPathForSelectedRow` returns nil, the else block will execute and the function will exit using `return`. This early exit prevents us from executing unnecessary code when the index path is not valid.
2. If the indexPath is successfully unwrapped, the code inside the else block will not execute, and we can proceed with the logic related to the valid index path.

Using guard statements in this scenario allows us to clearly handle the case when the index path is not valid and eliminates unnecessary nesting.

## Conclusion

By incorporating guard statements into your Swift code for handling user interface events, you can improve code readability, reduce nested blocks, and promote early exit when conditions are not met. Leveraging guard statements can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code in your iOS applications.
