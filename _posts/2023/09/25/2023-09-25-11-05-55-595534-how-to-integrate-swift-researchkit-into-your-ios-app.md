ResearchKit is an open-source framework developed by Apple that allows developers to easily create powerful medical research apps for iOS. In this tutorial, we will learn how to integrate Swift ResearchKit into your iOS app.

## Step 1: Setup

1. Open Xcode and create a new iOS project.
2. Import the ResearchKit framework into your project by adding it to your project's dependencies or by using CocoaPods.

## Step 2: Create a Research Study

1. Create a new Swift file and name it `StudySetup.swift`.
2. Import the ResearchKit module.
```
import ResearchKit
```
3. Define a function to create a Research Study. This function will set up the structure of your study, including tasks, consent forms, and surveys.
```
func createResearchStudy() -> ORKOrderedTask {
   // Add your study setup code here
}
```
4. Inside the function, you can use ResearchKit's APIs to create tasks and surveys based on your study requirements.
```
let questionStep = ORKQuestionStep(identifier: "questionStep", title: "Question", answer: ORKBooleanAnswerFormat())
```
5. Chain the steps to create a task using an `ORKOrderedTask`.
```
let task = ORKOrderedTask(identifier: "task", steps: [questionStep])
return task
```

## Step 3: Displaying the Research Study

1. Open your `ViewController.swift` file.
2. Import the ResearchKit module.
```
import ResearchKit
```
3. Define a function to start the Research Study.
```
func startResearchStudy() {
   let task = StudySetup.createResearchStudy()
   let taskViewController = ORKTaskViewController(task: task, taskRun: nil)
   taskViewController.delegate = self
   present(taskViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```
4. Implement the delegate methods to handle the completion of the task.
```
extension ViewController: ORKTaskViewControllerDelegate {
   func taskViewController(_ taskViewController: ORKTaskViewController, didFinishWith reason: ORKTaskViewControllerFinishReason, error: Error?) {
      // Handle task completion
   }
}
```
5. Finally, call the `startResearchStudy()` function to display the Research Study when needed.

## Step 4: Analyzing Research Results

1. In the `taskViewController(_:didFinishWith: error:)` method, you can access the research results and analyze them as needed.
```
if let results = taskViewController.result.results {
   for result in results {
      if let questionResult = result as? ORKBooleanQuestionResult {
         let answer = questionResult.booleanAnswer
         // Analyze the result
      }
   }
}
```

That's it! You have successfully integrated Swift ResearchKit into your iOS app. You can now create powerful medical research studies and collect valuable data using ResearchKit's APIs. Remember to follow ethical guidelines and ensure user privacy when conducting research using your app.
