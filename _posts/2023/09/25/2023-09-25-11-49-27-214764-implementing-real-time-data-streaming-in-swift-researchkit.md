Real-time data streaming plays a key role in many applications, including healthcare and scientific research. With the increasing popularity of mobile apps for data collection, it is important to enable real-time streaming of data to provide immediate feedback and analysis. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement real-time data streaming in Swift using ResearchKit framework.

## What is ResearchKit?

ResearchKit is an open-source framework developed by Apple for building apps that collect health data for medical research purposes. It provides a set of tools and APIs for designing and conducting scientific studies using iPhone apps. ResearchKit allows researchers to collect data, perform surveys, and conduct experiments through an intuitive user interface.

## Setting Up the Project

To start implementing real-time data streaming in Swift ResearchKit, you need to create a new iOS project and import the ResearchKit framework. Open Xcode and create a new Single View App project. Then, follow these steps to import ResearchKit:

1. In the project navigator, select your project's target.
2. Go to the "General" tab and scroll down to the "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" section.
3. Click on the "+" button to add a new framework.
4. Search for "ResearchKit" and select it from the search results.
5. Make sure to include "ResearchKit" in both "Embed & Sign" and "Do Not Embed" options.

## Capturing Real-Time Data

Let's assume we want to capture heart rate data in real-time using ResearchKit. We can create a custom task using the `ORKActiveStep` and `ORKHealthQuantityTypeRecorder` classes. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
import ResearchKit
import HealthKit

class HeartRateTaskViewController: ORKTaskViewController, ORKTaskViewControllerDelegate {
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        delegate = self
    }
    
    override func taskViewController(_ taskViewController: ORKTaskViewController, stepViewControllerWillAppear stepViewController: ORKStepViewController) {
        super.taskViewController(taskViewController, stepViewControllerWillAppear: stepViewController)
        
        // Configure HealthKit data collection
        let healthStore = HKHealthStore()
        guard let heartRateType = HKQuantityType.quantityType(forIdentifier: .heartRate) else {
            print("Unable to create a heart rate quantity type.")
            return
        }
        
        // Create a recorder to capture heart rate data
        let heartRateRecorder = ORKHealthQuantityTypeRecorder(identifier: "heartRateRecorder", quantityType: heartRateType, unit: HKUnit(from: "count/min"), healthStore: healthStore)
        
        // Create a task with the active step containing the heart rate recorder
        let activeStep = ORKActiveStep(identifier: "activeStep")
        activeStep.stepDuration = 30
        activeStep.recorder = heartRateRecorder
        
        let task = ORKOrderedTask(identifier: "task", steps: [activeStep])
        
        taskViewController.task = task
    }
}
```

In the above code, we create a custom `HeartRateTaskViewController` that extends `ORKTaskViewController` and conforms to `ORKTaskViewControllerDelegate`. In the `viewDidLoad()` method, we set the delegate to self. Then, in the `taskViewController(_: stepViewControllerWillAppear:)` method, we configure the HealthKit data collection by creating a health store and defining the heart rate quantity type. Next, we create a recorder to capture the heart rate data using the `ORKHealthQuantityTypeRecorder` class. Finally, we create an active step and assign the heart rate recorder to it. We then set the created task to the task view controller.

## Streaming Real-Time Data

To stream real-time data captured by ResearchKit, we can use various approaches. One approach is to implement delegate methods provided by the `ORKRecorderDelegate` protocol. The delegate methods are called when data is recorded during each step of the task. Here's an example of how to implement the delegate methods:

```swift
extension HeartRateTaskViewController: ORKRecorderDelegate {
    
    func recorder(_ recorder: ORKRecorder, didCompleteWithResult result: ORKResult) {
        if let healthQuantitySample = result.results?.first as? HKQuantitySample {
            let heartRate = healthQuantitySample.quantity.doubleValue(for: HKUnit(from: "count/min"))
            // Process real-time heart rate data here
        }
    }
    
    func recorder(_ recorder: ORKRecorder, didFailWithError error: Error) {
        print("Recorder error: \(error)")
    }
}
```

In the above extension, we implement the `recorder(_:didCompleteWithResult:)` method, which is called when the recorder completes recording the data. We extract the health quantity sample from the result and process the real-time heart rate data as required. We can also implement the `recorder(_:didFailWithError:)` method to handle any errors that occur during data recording.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to implement real-time data streaming in Swift ResearchKit. We started by setting up the project and importing the ResearchKit framework. Then, we explored how to capture real-time heart rate data using custom tasks and recorders. We also looked at how to stream the captured data using delegate methods. With this knowledge, you can now implement real-time data streaming in your own ResearchKit-based apps, enabling instant feedback and analysis in healthcare and scientific research.
