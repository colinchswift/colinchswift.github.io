Surveys and questionnaires are commonly used in research studies and data collection to gather information from participants. In Swift, ResearchKit is a powerful framework that makes it easy to implement surveys and questionnaires in your iOS app.

ResearchKit provides a set of pre-built question types, such as multiple-choice, text input, and scale questions, that you can use to create surveys. Additionally, it offers customizable question steps and result handling to suit your specific research needs.

In this article, we'll walk through the steps to implement surveys and questionnaires using Swift ResearchKit.

## Step 1: Setup ResearchKit in your project
To get started, you'll need to add ResearchKit as a dependency in your Xcode project. You can do this by adding ResearchKit as a Swift package or by adding it manually as a framework.

## Step 2: Create a survey task
Once you have ResearchKit set up in your project, you can create a survey task. A task represents a sequence of steps in a survey or questionnaire. Each step can be a question or an instruction.

```swift
import ResearchKit

func createSurveyTask() -> ORKOrderedTask {
    var steps = [ORKStep]()

    // Add your survey questions and instructions here
    let questionStep = ORKQuestionStep(identifier: "question1",
                                       title: "How satisfied are you with the app?",
                                       answerFormat: ORKAnswerFormat.scale(withMaximumValue: 5,
                                                                            minimumValue: 1,
                                                                            defaultValue: 3,
                                                                            step: 1,
                                                                            vertical: false,
                                                                            maximumValueDescription: "Very Satisfied",
                                                                            minimumValueDescription: "Not Satisfied"))
    steps.append(questionStep)

    // Add more survey questions and instructions as needed

    return ORKOrderedTask(identifier: "surveyTask", steps: steps)
}
```

In the code above, we create a survey task by creating a list of `ORKStep` objects. We create a `ORKQuestionStep` with a scale answer format as an example.

## Step 3: Present the survey task
Once you have your survey task defined, you can present it to the user using the `ORKTaskViewController`.

```swift
func presentSurveyTask() {
    let taskViewController = ORKTaskViewController(task: createSurveyTask(), taskRun: nil)
    taskViewController.delegate = self

    // Customize the task view controller if needed

    present(taskViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

In this code snippet, we create an instance of `ORKTaskViewController` with our survey task and set its delegate. We can also customize the appearance and behavior of the task view controller before presenting it to the user.

## Step 4: Handle survey results
To handle the survey results, you need to implement the delegate methods of `ORKTaskViewControllerDelegate`.

```swift
extension YourViewController: ORKTaskViewControllerDelegate {
    func taskViewController(_ taskViewController: ORKTaskViewController, didFinishWith reason: ORKTaskViewControllerFinishReason, error: Error?) {
        guard reason == .completed, let result = taskViewController.result else {
            // Handle task completion failure or cancellation
            return
        }

        // Process the survey results
        let stepResult = result.stepResult(forStepIdentifier: "question1")
        let scaleAnswer = (stepResult?.firstResult as? ORKScaleQuestionResult)?.scaleAnswer

        // Use the survey data as needed

        taskViewController.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
}
```

In the above code snippet, we implement the `taskViewController(_:didFinishWith:error:)` delegate method to handle the survey completion. We can extract the survey results by accessing the specific step result identifiers and their corresponding answer format types.

## Conclusion
With Swift ResearchKit, implementing surveys and questionnaires in your iOS app becomes much easier. Try out different question types, customize the appearance, and handle the survey results according to your research needs. Start initiating surveys and collecting valuable data from your users.
