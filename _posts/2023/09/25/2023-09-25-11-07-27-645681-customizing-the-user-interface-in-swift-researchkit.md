ResearchKit is a powerful framework developed by Apple that allows developers to create medical research applications quickly and easily. One of the key aspects of any application is its user interface. In this blog post, we will explore how to customize the user interface in Swift ResearchKit to create a unique and engaging experience for users.

## Customizing the Interface

ResearchKit provides a set of predefined user interface elements such as surveys, consent forms, and active tasks. However, it also allows developers to customize these elements to match the look and feel of their application.

### Customizing Surveys

Surveys are an essential part of any medical research application. With ResearchKit, you can customize the appearance of surveys by modifying their colors, fonts, and layout. For example, to change the color of the survey background, you can use the following code snippet:

```swift
let taskViewController = ORKOrderedTaskViewController(task: surveyTask, taskRun: nil)
taskViewController.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.white
```

### Customizing Consent Forms

Consent forms are another crucial component of medical research applications. ResearchKit offers a flexible framework to customize consent forms according to your specific requirements. You can modify the content, layout, and appearance of consent forms to match your application's branding.

For instance, to change the font of the consent form's title, you can use the following code snippet:

```swift
let consentDocument = ORKConsentDocument()
let titleFont = UIFont(name: "Helvetica-Bold", size: 18)!
let titleAttributes: [NSAttributedString.Key: Any] = [.foregroundColor: UIColor.black, .font: titleFont]
consentDocument.titleText = NSAttributedString(string: "My Study Consent Form", attributes: titleAttributes)
```

### Customizing Active Tasks

Active tasks, such as walking or tapping tests, play a vital role in medical research. ResearchKit enables developers to customize the look and feel of these tasks. You can modify aspects like step duration, instructions, and user feedback to provide a tailored experience to participants.

To customize the instructions for an active task, you can use the following code snippet:

```swift
let instructionStep = ORKInstructionStep(identifier: "instructionStep")
instructionStep.title = "Tap Test"
instructionStep.text = "Please tap the screen as fast as you can for 30 seconds."
instructionStep.detailText = "Tap with your index finger only."
instructionStep.iconImage = UIImage(named: "tap_icon")
```

## Conclusion

Customizing the user interface in Swift ResearchKit allows you to create a unique and engaging experience for users. By modifying the appearance and behavior of surveys, consent forms, and active tasks, you can tailor your application to meet your specific requirements and branding.
