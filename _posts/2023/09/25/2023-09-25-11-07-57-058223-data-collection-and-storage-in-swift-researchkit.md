iOS has become a popular platform for collecting and analyzing data, especially in the field of medical research. Apple introduced **ResearchKit** as an open-source framework to enable developers to create apps for medical studies and data collection. In this blog post, we will explore how to collect and store data using Swift ResearchKit.

## Setting Up ResearchKit

To get started, make sure you have **ResearchKit** added to your Xcode project. You can either use CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager to add ResearchKit as a dependency. Once you have ResearchKit integrated, you can start using its powerful data collection and storage features.

## Data Collection

ResearchKit offers various UI components known as **steps** to collect data from users. These steps can be used to create surveys, active tasks, questionnaires, and more. Each step represents a different type of data collection mechanism.

For example, to collect a survey response, you can use the `ORKFormStep` which provides a flexible interface for capturing user input. To capture movement data, you can use the `ORKActiveStep` which uses the device's sensors to track user activity.

## Data Storage

Once the user completes the data collection steps, you need to store the collected data securely. ResearchKit provides a built-in data storage solution called **HealthKit**. You can save the collected data to HealthKit to ensure its privacy and security.

To store data in HealthKit, you need to create `ORKResult` objects for each data point and then convert them to HealthKit compatible data types. For instance, you can store survey responses as `HKCategorySample` objects or movement data as `HKQuantitySample` objects.

## Example Code

Let's take a look at a simple example of data collection and storage in Swift ResearchKit:

```swift
import ResearchKit
import HealthKit

func collectData() {
    let surveyStep = ORKFormStep(identifier: "surveyStep", title: "Survey", text: "Please answer the following questions:")
    
    let surveyQuestion = ORKQuestionStep(identifier: "surveyQuestion", title: "Do you exercise regularly?", answer: ORKAnswerFormat.booleanAnswerFormat())
    
    surveyStep.formItems = [surveyQuestion]
    
    let task = ORKOrderedTask(identifier: "task", steps: [surveyStep])
    
    let taskViewController = ORKTaskViewController(task: task, taskRun: nil)
    taskViewController.delegate = self
    
    // Present the task view controller to collect data
    present(taskViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
}

func taskViewController(_ taskViewController: ORKTaskViewController, didFinishWith reason: ORKTaskViewControllerFinishReason, error: Error?) {
    // Handle data collection completion
    
    guard reason == .completed, let result = taskViewController.result else {
        return
    }
    
    let answers = (result.result(forIdentifier: "surveyQuestion") as? ORKBooleanQuestionResult)?.booleanAnswer ?? false
    
    // Transform collected data to HealthKit compatible types
    let workoutType = HKWorkoutType.workoutType()
    let workoutQuantity = HKQuantity(unit: HKUnit.count(), doubleValue: answers ? 1.0 : 0.0)
    let workoutSample = HKQuantitySample(type: workoutType, quantity: workoutQuantity, start: Date(), end: Date())
    
    // Save the collected data to HealthKit
    let healthStore = HKHealthStore()
    healthStore.save(workoutSample) { success, error in
        if success {
            // Data saved successfully
            print("Data saved to HealthKit")
        } else {
            // Failed to save data
            print("Error saving data to HealthKit:", error?.localizedDescription ?? "")
        }
    }
    
    // Dismiss the task view controller
    taskViewController.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

This example demonstrates the workflow of collecting survey responses and storing them as HealthKit samples. You can customize the data collection steps according to your study requirements.

## Summary

Swift ResearchKit provides a convenient way to collect and store data for medical research purposes. By leveraging ResearchKit's data collection steps and HealthKit integration, you can easily build iOS apps that facilitate user data collection and analysis. Make sure to explore the full range of ResearchKit features to build powerful medical research apps.
