In this blog post, we will explore how to integrate Apple HealthKit with Swift ResearchKit to leverage the powerful capabilities of both frameworks. HealthKit is a framework provided by Apple that allows developers to access and store health-related data on iOS devices. ResearchKit, on the other hand, is a framework that enables the creation of research studies and surveys on the iOS platform.

## Getting Started

Before we start integrating HealthKit with ResearchKit, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Xcode installed on your Mac.
2. An iOS device (running iOS 8 or later) with HealthKit capabilities.
3. Basic knowledge of Swift programming language.

## Step 1: Set Up HealthKit

First, we need to enable HealthKit capabilities for our project. Open your Xcode project and follow the steps below:

1. Select your project target and navigate to the "Capabilities" tab.
2. Enable "HealthKit" under "HealthKit" section.

Once HealthKit is enabled, we can start writing code to interact with it.

## Step 2: Interacting with HealthKit

To use HealthKit in your Swift ResearchKit project, you first need to import the HealthKit framework. Add the following line of code at the top of your Swift file:

```swift
import HealthKit
```

Now, you can start requesting authorization to access specific health data types. For instance, to request authorization to read and write steps count, add the following code snippet:

```swift
let healthStore = HKHealthStore()

let stepsCount = HKQuantityType.quantityType(forIdentifier: .stepCount)

guard let stepsCount = stepsCount else {
    print("Steps count not available.")
    return
}

healthStore.requestAuthorization(toShare: [stepsCount], read: [stepsCount]) { (success, error) in
    if success {
        print("Steps count authorization success!")
    } else {
        print("Steps count authorization failed: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "")")
    }
}
```

Note that this code will prompt the user for permission to access their steps count data.

## Step 3: Using HealthKit data in ResearchKit

Now that we have access to HealthKit data, we can use it within our ResearchKit project. To do that, you can leverage the HealthKit steps count data within your ResearchKit survey or study.

For example, let's say we want to display the user's steps count in a ResearchKit survey question. You can use the following code to retrieve the steps count data:

```swift
func retrieveStepsCount(completion: @escaping (Double) -> Void) {
    let stepsCount = HKQuantityType.quantityType(forIdentifier: .stepCount)
    
    let query = HKSampleQuery(sampleType: stepsCount!, predicate: nil, limit: HKObjectQueryNoLimit, sortDescriptors: nil) { (query, samples, error) in
        if let sample = samples?.first as? HKQuantitySample {
            let steps = sample.quantity.doubleValue(for: .count())
            completion(steps)
        }
    }
    
    healthStore.execute(query)
}

retrieveStepsCount { (steps) in
    print("Steps count: \(steps)")
    // Use the steps count in your ResearchKit survey question
}
```

With the above code, you can retrieve the user's steps count and pass it to your ResearchKit survey or study.

## Conclusion

Integrating Apple HealthKit with Swift ResearchKit can unlock numerous possibilities in healthcare research and studies. In this blog post, we went through the steps to enable HealthKit capabilities, request authorization, and use HealthKit data within ResearchKit. By leveraging these frameworks together, developers can create powerful and insightful healthcare applications on iOS.
