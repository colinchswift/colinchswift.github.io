## Introduction

In medical research studies, it is crucial to monitor data in real-time to ensure accurate and timely analysis. Swift ResearchKit provides a powerful framework for conducting research studies in iOS apps. However, by default, ResearchKit does not provide real-time data monitoring capabilities. In this blog post, we will discuss how to implement real-time data monitoring using Swift ResearchKit.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Xcode installed on your Mac
- Basic knowledge of Swift programming language
- Familiarity with ResearchKit

## Setting up the project

1. Open Xcode and create a new project using the "Single View App" template.
2. Import the `ResearchKit` framework into your project.
3. Create a new Swift file called `RealTimeMonitor.swift` to manage the real-time data monitoring functionality.

## Implementing real-time monitoring

To implement real-time monitoring in Swift ResearchKit, we need to perform the following steps:

### Step 1: Setting up data collection

ResearchKit provides various data collection types, such as surveys and active tasks. Choose the appropriate data collection type based on your research requirements. For example, if you want to collect heart rate data, use the `ORKHealthKitQuantityTypeIdentifierHeartRate` predefined type.

```swift
let heartRateType = HKObjectType.quantityType(forIdentifier: HKQuantityTypeIdentifier.heartRate)!
let heartRateUnit = HKUnit(from: "count/min")
let heartRateTypeDescriptor = ORKHealthKitQuantityTypeDescriptor(type: heartRateType, unit: heartRateUnit)
let heartRateFormItem = ORKFormItem(identifier: "heartRate", text: "Heart Rate", answerFormat: heartRateTypeDescriptor, optional: false)
```

### Step 2: Creating a real-time monitor

Create a custom subclass of `ORKActiveStepViewController` to monitor and display the real-time data. Override the `start` method to begin data collection and update the UI.

```swift
class RealTimeMonitorViewController: ORKActiveStepViewController {

    override func start() {
        super.start()
        // Start data collection
        // Update UI with real-time data
    }

    // Other required methods
}
```

### Step 3: Adding a real-time monitor to the study flow

In your ResearchKit study flow, add the custom `RealTimeMonitorViewController` as a step. Make sure to set the appropriate step identifier and title.

```swift
let realTimeMonitorStep = ORKStep(identifier: "realTimeMonitorStep")
realTimeMonitorStep.title = "Real-time Data Monitoring"
realTimeMonitorStep.stepViewControllerClass = RealTimeMonitorViewController.self
```

### Step 4: Registering health data permissions

Request authorization to access health data using `HKHealthStore.requestAuthorization(toShare:read:completion:)` method. This step is essential to access real-time health data.

```swift
let typesToShare = Set<HKSampleType>()
let typesToRead = Set([heartRateType])
let healthStore = HKHealthStore()
healthStore.requestAuthorization(toShare: typesToShare, read: typesToRead) { (success, error) in
    if success {
        // Health data authorization granted
    } else {
        // Health data authorization denied or error occurred
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Starting the real-time monitoring

Finally, create an instance of `ORKOrderedTask` and present it using `ORKTaskViewController` to start the real-time data monitoring.

```swift
let task = ORKOrderedTask(identifier: "realTimeTask", steps: [

    // Add necessary steps here

    realTimeMonitorStep,
])

let taskViewController = ORKTaskViewController(task: task, taskRun: nil)
taskViewController.delegate = self
present(taskViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

Now, when the task view controller is presented, the real-time monitor will start collecting data and updating the UI in real-time.

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can implement real-time data monitoring in Swift ResearchKit. This feature is essential for conducting accurate and timely medical research studies. Remember to handle data privacy and confidentiality appropriately when dealing with health-related data.
