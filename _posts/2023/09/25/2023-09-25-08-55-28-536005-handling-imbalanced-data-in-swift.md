## Introduction

Imbalanced data is a common problem in machine learning, where the number of instances belonging to one class is significantly higher than the other classes. This can lead to biased models and poor performance. In this blog post, we will explore different techniques to handle imbalanced data in Swift.

## 1. Data Resampling

### 1.1 Oversampling

Oversampling involves randomly duplicating instances from the minority class to create a balanced dataset. This can be done using the `RandomNumberGenerator` class in Swift. Below is an example code snippet:

```swift
import Foundation

func oversampleData(data: [Instance], minorityClass: ClassLabel) -> [Instance] {
    let minorityData = data.filter { instance in instance.label == minorityClass }
    var oversampledData = data
    let numberOfInstancesToAdd = data.count - minorityData.count
    let randomGenerator = RandomNumberGenerator()
    for _ in 0..<numberOfInstancesToAdd {
        let randomIndex = randomGenerator.nextInt(upperBound: minorityData.count)
        let randomInstance = minorityData[randomIndex]
        oversampledData.append(randomInstance)
    }
    return oversampledData
}
```

### 1.2 Undersampling

Undersampling involves randomly removing instances from the majority class to create a balanced dataset. Similarly, we can use the `RandomNumberGenerator` class to achieve this. Here is an example code snippet:

```swift
import Foundation

func undersampleData(data: [Instance], majorityClass: ClassLabel) -> [Instance] {
    let majorityData = data.filter { instance in instance.label == majorityClass }
    let minorityData = data.filter { instance in instance.label != majorityClass }
    var undersampledData = majorityData
    let numberOfInstancesToRemove = majorityData.count - minorityData.count
    let randomGenerator = RandomNumberGenerator()
    for _ in 0..<numberOfInstancesToRemove {
        let randomIndex = randomGenerator.nextInt(upperBound: majorityData.count)
        undersampledData.remove(at: randomIndex)
    }
    return undersampledData + minorityData
}
```

## 2. Using Class Weights

Another approach to handle imbalanced data is to assign weights to each class. This can be achieved by using the `MLClassifierMetrics` class in the `CoreML` framework in Swift. The class provides a `classWeight` property that allows you to assign weights to each class based on their occurrence in the dataset. Here is an example code snippet:

```swift
import CoreML

func trainModelWithClassWeights(data: [Instance]) {
    let model = createModel()
    let labels = data.map { instance in instance.label }
    let classCounts = labels.reduce(into: [:]) { counts, label in counts[label, default: 0] += 1 }
    let classWeights = labels.map { label in Double(data.count) / Double(classCounts[label] ?? 1) }
    let metrics = MLClassifierMetrics(classLabels: Array(Set(labels)), classWeights: classWeights)
    // Set the weights using metrics.classWeight before training the model
}
```

## Conclusion

Handling imbalanced data is crucial for building accurate and unbiased machine learning models. In this blog post, we discussed two techniques to handle imbalanced data in Swift: data resampling and using class weights. By employing these techniques, you can improve the performance of your machine learning models in Swift.
