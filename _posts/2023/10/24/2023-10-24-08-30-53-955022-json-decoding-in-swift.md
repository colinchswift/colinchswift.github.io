JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format widely used for representing structured data. In Swift, decoding JSON into native data types is made easy with the Codable protocol. With Codable, you can convert JSON data into Swift objects and vice versa.

## JSON decoding using Codable

Swift 4 introduced the Codable protocol, a powerful tool for serializing and deserializing data. To decode JSON data, you need to define a Swift structure or class that conforms to the Codable protocol. The structure of your Swift type should match the structure of the JSON data.

Consider the following example where we have JSON data representing a user:

```swift
struct User: Codable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
}
```

To decode JSON data into the `User` type, you can use the `JSONDecoder` class. Here's an example of JSON decoding:

```swift
let jsonData = """
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30
}
""".data(using: .utf8)

do {
    let user = try JSONDecoder().decode(User.self, from: jsonData)
    print(user)
} catch {
    print("Error decoding JSON: \(error)")
}
```

The `User` structure conforms to the `Codable` protocol, which provides automatic encoding and decoding capabilities. The `JSONDecoder` class is used to decode the JSON data into an instance of the `User` type.

## Decoding JSON with nested data

JSON data often contains nested objects or arrays. Codable allows you to handle such complex structures easily. You can define nested structures that conform to the Codable protocol and use them within the parent structure.

Consider the following example of nested JSON:

```swift
struct UserProfile: Codable {
    let user: User
    let bio: String
}

let jsonData = """
{
    "user": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "age": 30
    },
    "bio": "Hello, I'm John!"
}
""".data(using: .utf8)

do {
    let userProfile = try JSONDecoder().decode(UserProfile.self, from: jsonData)
    print(userProfile)
} catch {
    print("Error decoding JSON: \(error)")
}
```

Here, we define a `UserProfile` structure that contains a nested `User` structure. The JSONDecoder decodes the JSON data into an instance of `UserProfile`.

## Handling optional values

JSON data may contain optional values that are not present in every instance. Codable provides a way to handle optional values in a convenient manner.

Consider the following example where the `bio` field is an optional value:

```swift
struct UserProfile: Codable {
    let user: User
    let bio: String?
}
```

By making the `bio` field optional, the decoder can handle instances where the JSON data may or may not have a value for the `bio` key.

## Customizing the decoding process

In certain cases, you may need to customize the decoding process, such as mapping JSON keys to different property names in your Swift type. Codable allows you to achieve this by implementing the `CodingKeys` enumeration.

```swift
struct User: Codable {
    let fullName: String
    let userAge: Int

    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case fullName = "name"
        case userAge = "age"
    }
}
```

In this example, we customize the property names by using the `CodingKeys` enumeration.

## Conclusion

JSON decoding in Swift using the Codable protocol provides a simple and efficient way to convert JSON data into native Swift objects. By taking advantage of the automatic encoding and decoding capabilities of Codable, you can handle complex JSON structures with ease.
