In this tutorial, we will explore how to parse JSON data containing stock market information using Swift. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular data format for exchanging information between a server and a client.

## What is JSON?
JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of JavaScript, but it is language-independent. JSON data consists of key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects. It is widely used in web development and is the preferred format for data exchange between the server and client applications.

## Parsing JSON in Swift
To parse JSON data in Swift, we need to use the `JSONSerialization` class provided by the Foundation framework. This class allows us to convert a JSON object into Swift data types such as dictionaries and arrays.

```swift
guard let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/stockData") else {
    return
}

URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in
    if let error = error {
        print("Error: \(error)")
        return
    }
    
    guard let data = data else {
        print("No data received")
        return
    }
    
    do {
        let jsonObject = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: [])
        guard let json = jsonObject as? [String: Any] else {
            print("Invalid JSON format")
            return
        }
        
        // Now we have the parsed JSON data
        // Perform further operations with the data
        
    } catch {
        print("JSON parsing error: \(error)")
    }
}.resume()
```

In the code snippet above, we create a `URL` object with the URL of the API endpoint that provides the stock market data. Then, we use `URLSession` to create a data task and fetch the JSON data asynchronously. Once the data is received, we check for any errors, and if the data is non-nil, we call `JSONSerialization.jsonObject` to parse the JSON data.

## Using Codable
Swift 4 introduced a new way to parse JSON using the `Codable` protocol. By conforming to the `Codable` protocol, we can automatically decode JSON data into Swift structs or classes.

First, we define a struct that represents the JSON data structure:

```swift
struct Stock: Codable {
    let symbol: String
    let price: Double
    let volume: Int
    // Add more properties as needed
}

guard let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/stockData") else {
    return
}

URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in
    if let error = error {
        print("Error: \(error)")
        return
    }
    
    guard let data = data else {
        print("No data received")
        return
    }
    
    do {
        let decoder = JSONDecoder()
        let stocks = try decoder.decode([Stock].self, from: data)
        
        // Now we have an array of Stock objects
        
    } catch {
        print("JSON decoding error: \(error)")
    }
}.resume()
```

In this example, we define a `Stock` struct with properties corresponding to the JSON data fields. By declaring conformance to the `Codable` protocol, the `JSONDecoder` automatically maps the JSON data to our Swift structs.

## Conclusion
Parsing JSON data is a common task in many iOS applications. In this tutorial, we explored how to parse JSON containing stock market data in Swift using the `JSONSerialization` class and the `Codable` protocol. This knowledge will help you interact with APIs that provide stock market information and integrate it into your iOS apps.
