In modern app development, it's common to exchange data in JSON format between client-side and server-side. JSON provides a lightweight and human-readable way to transmit data. However, when dealing with binary data, such as images or files, it can be a bit challenging to parse and handle that data.

In this blog post, we'll explore how to parse JSON with binary data in Swift, specifically by using the `Codable` protocol and `URLSession` to download and parse the binary data.

## Introduction to JSON parsing

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a standard data format used for transmitting and exchanging data between a web server and a client application. It's a text-based format that consists of key-value pairs and arrays.

In Swift, the `Codable` protocol provides an easy way to convert JSON data into custom Swift objects and vice versa. By conforming to the `Codable` protocol, we can easily serialize and deserialize JSON data.

## Parsing JSON with binary data

When JSON contains binary data, such as images or files, we need to handle it differently. Instead of directly decoding the binary data as a string or number, we need to download it separately and then parse it.

To parse JSON with binary data in Swift, follow these steps:

### Fetching JSON data

First, we need to fetch the JSON data from the server using `URLSession`. Here's an example of how to do it:

```swift
guard let url = URL(string: "https://example.com/api/data") else {
    return
}

let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in
    if let error = error {
        print("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        return
    }

    // Parse JSON data
}

task.resume()
```

In the above code, we create a `URLSession` and initialize a `dataTask` with the URL. The `dataTask` fetches the JSON data asynchronously. In the completion handler, we can parse the JSON data.

### Parsing binary data

To parse binary data within JSON, we can use `JSONDecoder` along with custom decoding strategies. Here's an example of decoding JSON with binary data:

```swift
struct ImageData: Codable {
    let data: Data
    let contentType: String
}

let decoder = JSONDecoder()
decoder.dataDecodingStrategy = .custom { decoder -> Data in
    let container = try decoder.singleValueContainer()
    if let base64String = try? container.decode(String.self),
       let data = Data(base64Encoded: base64String) {
        return data
    } else {
        return try container.decode(Data.self)
    }
}

do {
    let imageData = try decoder.decode(ImageData.self, from: jsonData)
    // Use the parsed binary data
} catch {
    print("Error decoding JSON: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

In the above code, we define a `ImageData` struct that represents the JSON structure. We then configure a `JSONDecoder` to handle the decoding of binary data.

We set the `dataDecodingStrategy` to a custom closure that checks if the value can be decoded as a base64 encoded string. If it can be, we decode it as `Data`. Otherwise, we decode it as regular `Data`.

Finally, we use the `decode` method of the `JSONDecoder` to parse the JSON data into the `ImageData` struct.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we've learned how to parse JSON with binary data in Swift. By utilizing the `Codable` protocol and configuring a custom decoding strategy, we can easily handle binary data within JSON.

Remember to handle binary data carefully, as it may increase memory usage and affect app performance. It's always a good practice to optimize binary data handling for better user experience.
