In Swift, parsing JSON data has become significantly easier and more convenient with the introduction of Codable in Swift 4. Codable is a protocol that allows you to encode and decode custom Swift types to and from different external representations, such as JSON. It combines the functionality of the Encodable and Decodable protocols into a single protocol, making it a breeze to work with JSON data.

## Defining a Codable struct or class

To use Codable for JSON parsing, you need to define a struct or class that conforms to the Codable protocol. The properties in your struct or class should have types that also conform to Codable. For example, consider the following JSON data representing a user:

```swift
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

You can define a struct in Swift to represent this user as follows:

```swift
struct User: Codable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
    let email: String
}
```

## Encoding and decoding JSON data

Once you have defined your Codable struct or class, you can easily encode and decode JSON data using the `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` classes provided by Swift.

To encode your struct or class to JSON data, you can use the `encode` method of `JSONEncoder`. For example:

```swift
let user = User(name: "John Doe", age: 30, email: "john.doe@example.com")

do {
    let jsonEncoder = JSONEncoder()
    let jsonData = try jsonEncoder.encode(user)
    let jsonString = String(data: jsonData, encoding: .utf8)
    print(jsonString)
} catch {
    print("Error encoding user: \(error)")
}
```

To decode JSON data back into your struct or class, you can use the `decode` method of `JSONDecoder`. For example:

```swift
let jsonString = """
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
"""

if let jsonData = jsonString.data(using: .utf8) {
    do {
        let jsonDecoder = JSONDecoder()
        let user = try jsonDecoder.decode(User.self, from: jsonData)
        print(user.name)
        print(user.age)
        print(user.email)
    } catch {
        print("Error decoding user: \(error)")
    }
}
```

## Customizing encoding and decoding behavior

Codable provides default encoding and decoding behavior based on the properties in your struct or class. However, you can customize this behavior by implementing the `CodingKey` protocol in your struct or class. By implementing `CodingKey`, you can define custom keys for your JSON properties, handle mappings between property names and JSON keys, and ignore specific properties during encoding or decoding.

## Conclusion

Using Codable for JSON parsing in Swift makes the process of encoding and decoding JSON data much more intuitive and straightforward. By conforming to the Codable protocol, you can easily convert Swift types into JSON data and vice versa. The JSONEncoder and JSONDecoder classes handle the heavy lifting, allowing you to focus on your data model. Codable is a powerful tool that simplifies JSON parsing in Swift, making your code cleaner and more maintainable.
