When working with JSON data in Swift, there may be cases where you need to transform or modify the data during the parsing process. Fortunately, Swift provides several convenient ways to accomplish this. In this blog post, we will explore how to transform JSON data during parsing in Swift.

## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular data interchange format that is widely used in web development. In Swift, you can easily parse JSON data using the `JSONSerialization` class provided by the Foundation framework.

## Parsing JSON Data<a name="parsing-json-data"></a>

Before we dive into transforming JSON data, let's first cover the basics of parsing JSON in Swift. Here's an example of how to parse JSON data:

```swift
guard let jsonData = jsonString.data(using: .utf8),
      let jsonObject = try? JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: jsonData, options: []) else {
    // Handle parsing error
    return
}

if let dictionary = jsonObject as? [String: Any] {
    // Access individual values from the JSON
    let name = dictionary["name"] as? String
    let age = dictionary["age"] as? Int
    // ...
}

if let array = jsonObject as? [Any] {
    // Access individual elements from the JSON array
    for item in array {
        // ...
    }
}
```

In the above code, we convert the JSON string into `Data` using the `utf8` encoding. Then, we use the `JSONSerialization` class to parse the JSON data and obtain either a dictionary or an array depending on the structure of the JSON.

## Transforming JSON Data<a name="transforming-json-data"></a>

Now, let's see how we can transform or modify the JSON data during the parsing process. One common use case is converting the JSON data into custom model objects. Suppose we have the following JSON data representing a person:

```json
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

To parse this JSON data and transform it into a custom `Person` object, we can create a struct that conforms to the `Decodable` protocol and define the desired transformation in its implementation.

```swift
struct Person: Decodable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
    let email: String
    
    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
    case name
    case age
    case email = "email_address"
    }
}

guard let jsonData = jsonString.data(using: .utf8) else {
    return
}

do {
    let person = try JSONDecoder().decode(Person.self, from: jsonData)
    print(person.name) // John Doe
    print(person.age) // 30
    print(person.email) // john.doe@example.com
} catch {
    // Handle parsing or decoding error
}
```

In the above code, we define a `Person` struct that conforms to the `Decodable` protocol. We also define a `CodingKeys` enum to specify custom key mappings if needed. For example, the `email` property in the JSON has the key `"email_address"`, so we provide the corresponding mapping in the `CodingKeys` enum.

We can then use `JSONDecoder` to decode the JSON data into an instance of `Person`. The decoding process will automatically map the JSON fields to the struct properties and apply any defined transformations.

## Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>

Transforming JSON data during parsing is a common requirement in Swift projects. By using the `Decodable` protocol and `JSONDecoder` class, you can easily transform JSON data into custom model objects with little effort. This allows for cleaner and more structured code when working with JSON in Swift.

In this blog post, we've covered the basic steps for parsing JSON data in Swift and demonstrated how to transform or modify the data during the process. We hope you find this information useful in your JSON parsing endeavors.
