JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely used format for transmitting data between a server and a client. It is easy to parse JSON data using libraries like Codable in Swift. However, parsing JSON with circular references can introduce some complexities. In this blog post, we will explore how to handle circular references while parsing JSON in Swift.

## What are Circular References?

Circular references occur when objects in a JSON structure reference each other in a circular manner. For example, consider the following JSON snippet:

```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "friend": {
    "name": "Jane",
    "friend": {
      "name": "John"
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, both John and Jane reference each other as friends, creating a circular reference.

## Challenges of Parsing JSON with Circular References

When parsing JSON with circular references, the main challenge is avoiding infinite loops while decoding the data. By default, the JSON decoding process in Swift can lead to infinite recursion when encountering circular references. This can result in stack overflow errors or an endless loop.

To overcome this challenge, we need to handle circular references explicitly in our JSON parsing logic.

## Handling Circular References in Swift

To handle circular references while parsing JSON in Swift, we can use the `init(from: Decoder)` method from the `Decoder` protocol. This method allows us to customize the decoding process and handle circular references manually.

When implementing this method, we need to keep track of the objects that have been decoded already to avoid infinite recursion. We can use a dictionary to store the decoded objects and their corresponding unique identifiers. Here's an example of how this can be done:

```swift
class Person: Codable {

    let name: String
    var friend: Person?

    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case name
        case friend
    }

    required init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)

        name = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .name)
        friend = try container.decodeIfPresent(Person.self, forKey: .friend)

        // Store the decoded Person object with a unique identifier
        if let identifier = try container.decodeIfPresent(String.self, forKey: .someUniqueIdentifier) {
            // Check if the object has already been decoded
            if let existingPerson = DecodedObjectsStore.shared.getObject(identifier: identifier) {
                friend = existingPerson
            } else {
                DecodedObjectsStore.shared.storeObject(object: self, identifier: identifier)
            }
        }
    }
}

class DecodedObjectsStore {
    static let shared = DecodedObjectsStore()

    private var decodedObjects = [String: Person]()

    func getObject(identifier: String) -> Person? {
        return decodedObjects[identifier]
    }

    func storeObject(object: Person, identifier: String) {
        decodedObjects[identifier] = object
    }
}
```

In the above code snippet, we create a `DecodedObjectsStore` class that acts as a global store for the decoded objects. When decoding a `Person` object, we check if the unique identifier exists in the JSON, and if it does, we check if the object has already been decoded and stored in the `DecodedObjectsStore`. If the object already exists, we assign it to the `friend` property. Otherwise, we store the object in the `DecodedObjectsStore` for future reference.

By using this approach, we can successfully parse JSON with circular references without getting caught in an infinite loop.

## Conclusion

When working with JSON data that contains circular references, it is essential to handle them explicitly to avoid infinite recursion. By customizing the decoding process and using a store to keep track of the decoded objects, we can successfully parse JSON structures with circular references in Swift.

Remember to handle circular references carefully to ensure your application's stability and integrity when dealing with complex JSON data.
