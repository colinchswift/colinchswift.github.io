One of the common challenges when working with APIs that return large sets of data is handling pagination. Pagination allows us to retrieve data in smaller chunks, making it more efficient and easier to manage. One popular approach to pagination is cursor-based pagination, which uses a cursor (such as an ID or timestamp) to keep track of the last fetched item and retrieve the next set of results.

In this article, we will explore how to handle JSON pagination with cursor-based pagination in Swift. We will write Swift code snippets to demonstrate the implementation.

## Understanding Cursor-Based Pagination

Cursor-based pagination relies on using a cursor to represent the last fetched item from the previous page. The cursor could be an ID, timestamp, or any other unique identifier provided by the API.

The basic flow of cursor-based pagination is as follows:

1. Make an initial request to retrieve the first page of data.
2. Extract the cursor value from the response to keep track of the last fetched item.
3. Use this cursor to include it in subsequent requests to fetch the next page of data.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until there are no more pages or the desired data is fetched.

## Implementing Cursor-Based Pagination in Swift

Let's assume we have an API endpoint that returns paginated JSON data with a `cursor` field indicating the last fetched item. We can use URLSession to send HTTP requests and URLSessionDataTask to handle fetching data.

```swift
import Foundation

class Paginator {
    private var cursor: String?
    
    func fetchData() {
        var urlComponents = URLComponents(string: "https://api.example.com/data")
        if let cursor = cursor {
            urlComponents?.queryItems = [URLQueryItem(name: "cursor", value: cursor)]
        }
        
        guard let url = urlComponents?.url else { return }
        
        let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in
            if let error = error {
                print("Error: \(error)")
                return
            }
            
            if let data = data {
                do {
                    let json = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: [])
                    self.handleResponse(json)
                } catch {
                    print("Error parsing JSON: \(error)")
                }
            }
        }
        
        task.resume()
    }
    
    private func handleResponse(_ json: Any) {
        // Parse and process the JSON response
        // Extract the cursor from the response and store it
        
        // Example implementation for a JSON response with a "cursor" field
        if let responseDict = json as? [String: Any], let cursor = responseDict["cursor"] as? String {
            self.cursor = cursor
        }
        
        // Continue fetching data if there are more pages
        if cursor != nil {
            fetchData()
        } else {
            // All pages fetched, handle the complete data set
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, we have a `Paginator` class that uses URLSession and URLSessionDataTask to fetch paginated data. The `fetchData` method constructs the request URL based on the current cursor value. It then sends the request and handles the response in the `handleResponse` method.

The `handleResponse` method parses the JSON response and extracts the cursor value. If a cursor is present, it calls `fetchData` again to fetch the next page. If no cursor is available, it means all pages have been fetched, and we can handle the complete data set.

## Conclusion

Cursor-based pagination is an effective way to handle JSON pagination when working with large data sets from APIs. By using a cursor to keep track of the last fetched item, we can easily fetch subsequent pages of data. In this article, we demonstrated how to implement cursor-based pagination in Swift using URLSession. Feel free to adapt this code to your specific API needs.
