When working with JSON data in Swift, it is common to use libraries and frameworks to simplify the process. One popular library is Codable, which allows you to convert JSON data to native Swift types.

However, there may be cases when you only need a subset of the JSON properties and want to ignore the irrelevant ones. In this blog post, we will explore how to ignore irrelevant JSON properties during the parsing process in Swift.

## Using Codable protocol

The Codable protocol provides a simple and expressive way to encode and decode JSON data. Typically, you create a struct or class that conforms to the Codable protocol and define the properties that correspond to the JSON data.

To ignore irrelevant properties, you can use the `CodingKeys` enum in Swift. By providing custom coding keys, you can map only the relevant JSON properties to your struct or class.

Here's an example:

```swift
struct User: Codable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int

    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case name
        // ignoring the "email" property
    }

    init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        self.name = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .name)
        // ignoring the "email" property
    }

    func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
        var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        try container.encode(name, forKey: .name)
        // ignoring the "email" property
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a `User` struct with `name` and `age` properties. We have explicitly ignored the "email" property by not including it in the `CodingKeys` enum.

## Using third-party libraries

If you prefer to use third-party libraries for JSON parsing in Swift, there are options available that also allow you to ignore irrelevant properties.

One popular library is SwiftyJSON, which provides a convenient way to parse and manipulate JSON data.

Here's an example of how you can ignore irrelevant properties using SwiftyJSON:

```swift
import SwiftyJSON

let json = """
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 25,
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
"""

let userJson = JSON(parseJSON: json)

let name = userJson["name"].stringValue
let age = userJson["age"].intValue
// ignoring the "email" property
```

By accessing only the relevant properties in the JSON object, you can effectively ignore the irrelevant properties.

## Conclusion

When working with JSON data in Swift, it is often necessary to ignore irrelevant properties during the parsing process. By using the Codable protocol or third-party libraries such as SwiftyJSON, you can easily achieve this. This allows you to focus only on the properties that are relevant to your application, resulting in cleaner and more efficient code.
