JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular format for exchanging data between different platforms and programming languages. In Swift, parsing JSON data has become much easier with the introduction of the `JSONDecoder` and `JSONEncoder` classes. These classes are part of the Foundation framework and are available in iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

## JSONDecoder

The `JSONDecoder` class is used to convert a JSON-encoded data or JSON object into a Swift data structure. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use `JSONDecoder` for JSON parsing:

1. Create a `struct` or `class` that represents the structure of the JSON data you want to parse.

    ```swift
    struct Person: Codable {
        let name: String
        let age: Int
        let email: String
    }
    ```

2. Get the JSON data as a `Data` object. This can be obtained from various sources, such as a network request or reading from a local file.

3. Use the `decode(_:from:)` method of `JSONDecoder` to parse the JSON data into your Swift data structure.

    ```swift
    let json = """
        {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "age": 25,
            "email": "johndoe@example.com"
        }
        """.data(using: .utf8)!

    do {
        let person = try JSONDecoder().decode(Person.self, from: json)
        print(person.name) // Output: John Doe
        print(person.age) // Output: 25
        print(person.email) // Output: johndoe@example.com
    } catch {
        print("Error decoding JSON: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
    ```

    Note that the `decode(_:from:)` method throws an error if the JSON data is not valid or if the structure of the data doesn't match the structure defined in your `struct` or `class`.

## JSONEncoder

The `JSONEncoder` class is used to convert a Swift data structure into JSON-encoded data or a JSON object. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use `JSONEncoder` for JSON serialization:

1. Create an instance of the Swift data structure you want to serialize into JSON.

    ```swift
    let person = Person(name: "John Doe", age: 25, email: "johndoe@example.com")
    ```

2. Use the `encode(_:)` method of `JSONEncoder` to serialize the Swift data structure into JSON-encoded data.

    ```swift
    do {
        let json = try JSONEncoder().encode(person)
        let jsonString = String(data: json, encoding: .utf8)
        print(jsonString ?? "") // Output: {"name":"John Doe","age":25,"email":"johndoe@example.com"}
    } catch {
        print("Error encoding JSON: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
    ```

The `encode(_:)` method throws an error if the Swift data structure cannot be encoded into JSON format.

## Conclusion

With the `JSONDecoder` and `JSONEncoder` classes in Swift, parsing and serializing JSON becomes a breeze. These classes provide a straightforward way to convert between JSON and Swift data structures, making it easier to integrate with web services or handle JSON data in your Swift applications.

By utilizing the power of Swift's Codable protocol, you can easily define the structure of your JSON data using `struct`s or `class`es. JSONDecoder and JSONEncoder take care of the heavy lifting, allowing you to focus on writing clean and maintainable code.
