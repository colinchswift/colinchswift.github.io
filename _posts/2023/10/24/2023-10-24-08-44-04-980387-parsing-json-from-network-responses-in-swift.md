When working with network requests in Swift, it's common to receive responses in JSON format. In order to make use of this data, we need to parse it into a usable Swift type. In this blog post, we will explore how to parse JSON from network responses in Swift.

## Introduction

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy to read and write for humans, and easy to parse and generate for machines. Swift provides built-in support for working with JSON through its `Codable` protocol.

## Fetching JSON data

Before we can parse JSON, we first need to fetch the JSON data from a network request. For this, we can use the `URLSession` class in Swift. Below is an example of how to make a network request and receive JSON data:

```swift
import Foundation

let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/data")!
let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in
    if let error = error {
        print("Error: \(error)")
        return
    }
    
    guard let data = data else {
        print("No data received")
        return
    }
    
    // Parse the JSON data here
}

task.resume()
```

In the above example, we create a `URL` object with the URL of the JSON endpoint. We then initiate a `URLSession` data task to make the network request. Inside the completion handler, we check for any errors and ensure that we have received the JSON data successfully.

## Parsing JSON

Once we have the JSON data, we can parse it into a Swift structure using the `Codable` protocol. This protocol allows us to decode the JSON data into a Swift type by defining its structure and providing the appropriate coding keys. Below is an example of how to parse JSON using `Codable`:

```swift
struct Person: Codable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
}

do {
    let decoder = JSONDecoder()
    let person = try decoder.decode(Person.self, from: data)
    print("Name: \(person.name), Age: \(person.age)")
} catch {
    print("Error decoding JSON: \(error)")
}
```

In the above example, we define a `Person` struct that conforms to the `Codable` protocol. We then create an instance of `JSONDecoder` to decode the JSON data. By calling `decode(_:from:)` on the decoder, we can decode the data into an instance of the `Person` struct.

## Conclusion

Parsing JSON from network responses is a common task in Swift development. By using the `URLSession` class to fetch the JSON data and the `Codable` protocol to parse it, we can easily work with JSON data in Swift. This allows us to seamlessly integrate API responses into our applications.
