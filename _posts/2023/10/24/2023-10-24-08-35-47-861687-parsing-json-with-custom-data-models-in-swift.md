JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely used format for data interchange between a server and a client. In Swift, parsing JSON can be done using built-in libraries such as `JSONSerialization` or third-party libraries like `SwiftyJSON`. While these libraries can simplify the parsing process, they often require manual mapping of JSON data to custom data models.

In this blog post, we will explore how to parse JSON in Swift using custom data models. We will start by creating the data model and then demonstrate how to parse JSON data into instances of this model.

## Creating a Custom Data Model

Before parsing JSON, it's important to define a custom data model that represents the structure of the JSON data. This model will allow us to easily work with JSON data in a type-safe manner.

Let's say we have a JSON response representing a user:

```swift
{
   "id": 1,
   "name": "John Doe",
   "email": "johndoe@example.com"
}
```

To parse this JSON into a custom data model in Swift, we can define a `User` struct:

```swift
struct User {
   let id: Int
   let name: String
   let email: String
}
```

In this example, the `User` struct has `id`, `name`, and `email` properties with the corresponding types defined in the JSON.

## Parsing JSON into the Data Model

To parse the JSON data into an instance of the `User` model, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Retrieve the JSON Data

First, we need to retrieve the JSON data from a server or load it from a file. In this example, we assume the JSON data is already fetched and stored in the `jsonData` variable.

### Step 2: Deserialize JSON

Next, we need to deserialize the JSON data into a `Dictionary` using the built-in `JSONSerialization` class:

```swift
guard let jsonDictionary = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: jsonData, options: []) as? [String: Any] else {
   // Error handling
   return
}
```

### Step 3: Map JSON to the Data Model

Finally, we can map the JSON dictionary to the `User` data model by extracting the values and initializing an instance of the `User` struct:

```swift
guard let id = jsonDictionary["id"] as? Int,
      let name = jsonDictionary["name"] as? String,
      let email = jsonDictionary["email"] as? String else {
   // Error handling
   return
}

let user = User(id: id, name: name, email: email)
```

Now we have successfully parsed the JSON data into an instance of our custom `User` data model.

## Conclusion

Parsing JSON in Swift with custom data models allows for type-safe and convenient handling of JSON data. By defining a custom data model, we can easily map JSON to Swift objects and access the data in a structured manner.

Using the steps outlined in this blog post, you can parse JSON data into custom data models and leverage the power of Swift's type system to work with JSON easily and safely.
