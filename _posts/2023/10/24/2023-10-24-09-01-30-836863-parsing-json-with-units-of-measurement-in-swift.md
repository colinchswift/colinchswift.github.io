Parsing JSON is a common task in Swift development, but what if the JSON data includes units of measurement? In this blog post, we will explore how you can parse JSON with units of measurement using Swift.

## Introduction
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular data format for exchanging data between a server and a client. It is often used in web APIs and mobile app development. When parsing JSON data, we typically map the JSON fields to corresponding properties in our Swift data model. However, when the JSON includes units of measurement (e.g., "10 meters" or "5 kilograms"), parsing becomes a bit more complex.

## Understanding the JSON structure
Before we dive into parsing JSON with units of measurement, let's first understand the structure of the JSON. Imagine we have a JSON response that includes a property called "length" with a value of "10 meters". This could look like:

```swift
{
   "length": "10 meters"
}
```

In this example, the value of "length" is a string that includes both the numerical value and the unit of measurement. To parse this value correctly, we need to separate the numeric part from the unit part.

## Parsing JSON with units of measurement in Swift
To parse JSON with units of measurement in Swift, we can use regular expressions or string manipulation techniques to extract the numeric value and the unit of measurement separately. Once we have extracted these values, we can use them to initialize our data model object.

For example, let's say we have a `Measurement` struct that represents a measurement with a value and a unit. We can define a custom initializer that takes a string value and separates it into the numeric value and the unit part:

```swift
struct Measurement {
    let value: Double
    let unit: String
    
    init(valueString: String) {
        let regexPattern = "^(\\d+\\.?\\d*)\\s(\\w+)$"
        let regex = try! NSRegularExpression(pattern: regexPattern, options: [])
        
        if let match = regex.firstMatch(in: valueString, options: [], range: NSRange(location: 0, length: valueString.count)) {
            if let valueRange = Range(match.range(at: 1), in: valueString),
               let unitRange = Range(match.range(at: 2), in: valueString) {
                let valueSubstring = valueString[valueRange]
                let unitSubstring = valueString[unitRange]
                
                value = Double(valueSubstring)!
                unit = String(unitSubstring)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we use a regular expression pattern to match the numeric value and the unit part of the string. If a match is found, we extract the substrings and initialize the `Measurement` struct with the extracted values.

## Example code
Let's see an example of parsing JSON with units of measurement in Swift:

```swift
guard let jsonData = jsonString.data(using: .utf8) else {
    return
}

do {
    let jsonObject = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: jsonData, options: []) as? [String: Any]

    if let lengthString = jsonObject["length"] as? String {
        let lengthMeasurement = Measurement(valueString: lengthString)
        print("Length: \(lengthMeasurement.value) \(lengthMeasurement.unit)")
    }
} catch {
    print("Error parsing JSON: \(error)")
}
```

In this example, we parse the JSON string into a JSON object and extract the value of the "length" property. We then use the `Measurement` struct to parse the value and print the result.

## Conclusion
Parsing JSON with units of measurement in Swift requires special handling to separate the numeric value from the unit part. By using regular expressions or string manipulation techniques, we can extract the necessary values and initialize our data model accordingly. Keep in mind that this approach may vary depending on your specific JSON structure and requirements.

Parsing JSON with units of measurement adds an additional layer of complexity to the parsing process, but with the right techniques, it can be done effectively in Swift.
