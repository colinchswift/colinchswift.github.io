In many RESTful APIs, pagination is often used to limit the number of results returned in a single request. One common pagination strategy is *offset-based pagination*, where the client specifies the number of records to skip before returning results. This approach is commonly used with APIs that return JSON data.

In this blog post, we will explore how to handle JSON pagination with offset-based pagination in Swift. We will utilize the `URLSession` class to make HTTP requests, decode JSON data using the `Codable` protocol, and implement pagination logic to retrieve all the paginated data.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you should have basic knowledge of Swift programming and familiarity with the `URLSession` and `Codable` protocols in Swift.

## Understanding Offset-Based Pagination
Offset-based pagination involves the use of two parameters: `limit` and `offset`. The `limit` parameter specifies the maximum number of records to be returned in a single request, while the `offset` parameter is used to skip a certain number of records before returning results.

The initial request would typically include a `limit` parameter to specify the number of results to retrieve and set the `offset` parameter to 0. Further requests would increment the `offset` value to retrieve the next set of records.

## Implementing JSON Pagination in Swift
To handle JSON pagination with offset-based pagination in Swift, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Create a data model that conforms to the `Codable` protocol. This model will represent the JSON structure we are retrieving from the API.
2. Implement a function to make the HTTP request and retrieve the initial set of results.
3. Parse the JSON response using the `Codable` protocol.
4. Extract the `offset` and `limit` values from the API response.
5. Implement a loop to continuously retrieve the remaining paginated data by incrementing the `offset` value until all data is retrieved.

Here is an example implementation of the above steps:

```swift
struct Person: Codable {
    let id: Int
    let name: String
    // Add any other properties from the API response
    
    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case id
        case name
        // Add any other properties from the API response
    }
}

func retrievePaginatedData() {
    var offset = 0
    let limit = 50
    
    while true {
        // Make the HTTP request with the appropriate offset and limit parameters
        let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/data?offset=\(offset)&limit=\(limit)")!
        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in
            // Handle the response and error
            guard let data = data else {
                print("Error retrieving data: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "Unknown error")")
                return
            }
            
            // Parse the JSON response
            do {
                let decoder = JSONDecoder()
                let paginatedData = try decoder.decode([Person].self, from: data)
                // Process the retrieved paginated data
                
                // Extract the offset and limit values from the API response
                offset += paginatedData.count
                guard let totalCount = response.allHeaderFields["X-Total-Count"] as? Int else {
                    print("Total count header missing")
                    return
                }
                
                if offset >= totalCount {
                    // Exit the loop if all data has been retrieved
                    return
                }
            } catch {
                print("Error decoding JSON data: \(error.localizedDescription)")
            }
        }.resume()
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Person` struct represents the JSON structure we expect to receive from the API. We use the `Codable` protocol to decode the JSON data into instances of `Person`.

The `retrievePaginatedData()` function makes an initial HTTP request with the specified `offset` and `limit` values. It then parses the JSON response, extracts the `offset` and `limit` values, and continues to retrieve the remaining paginated data until all the records are retrieved.

## Conclusion
Handling JSON pagination with offset-based pagination in Swift requires making multiple HTTP requests and appropriately updating the `offset` value. By implementing the steps outlined in this blog post, you can efficiently retrieve all the paginated data from the API. Remember to handle errors and update the data model and API endpoint as per your specific requirements.
