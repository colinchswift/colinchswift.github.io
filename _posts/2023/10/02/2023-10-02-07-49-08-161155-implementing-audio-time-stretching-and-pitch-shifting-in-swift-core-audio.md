In this blog post, we will explore how to implement audio time stretching and pitch shifting using Swift and Core Audio. Time stretching and pitch shifting are two essential techniques used in audio processing to alter the duration and pitch of audio signals without affecting their overall quality.

## What is Time Stretching and Pitch Shifting?

**Time stretching** is the process of changing the duration of an audio signal while retaining its pitch. This technique is commonly used in applications like music production, audio editing, and audio stretching.

**Pitch shifting** is the process of altering the pitch of an audio signal while keeping its duration intact. It is widely utilized in applications such as audio effects, voice modification, and instrument tuning.

## Tools and Libraries

To implement audio time stretching and pitch shifting in Swift, we will be using the Core Audio framework. Core Audio is a powerful framework provided by Apple for working with low-level audio on iOS, macOS, and tvOS.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Import Core Audio Framework**

```swift
import AVFoundation
```

2. **Create an AVAudioEngine**

```swift
let audioEngine = AVAudioEngine()
```

3. **Load and Attach the Audio File**

```swift
let audioFile = try AVAudioFile(forReading: audioURL)
let audioPlayer = AVAudioPlayerNode()

audioEngine.attach(audioPlayer)
```

4. **Create an AVAudioUnitTimePitch for Pitch Shifting**

```swift
let pitchShift = AVAudioUnitTimePitch()
audioEngine.attach(pitchShift)

pitchShift.pitch = 400
```
Here, we are creating an `AVAudioUnitTimePitch` and setting its `pitch` property to 400 to shift the pitch by +400 cents (four semitones).

5. **Create an AVAudioUnitVarispeed for Time Stretching**

```swift
let timeStretch = AVAudioUnitVarispeed()
audioEngine.attach(timeStretch)

timeStretch.rate = 2.0
```

Here, we are creating an `AVAudioUnitVarispeed` and setting its `rate` property to 2.0 to double the playback rate, resulting in time stretching.

6. **Connect and Start the Audio Engine**

```swift
audioEngine.connect(audioPlayer, to: pitchShift, format: nil)
audioEngine.connect(pitchShift, to: timeStretch, format: nil)
audioEngine.connect(timeStretch, to: audioEngine.mainMixerNode, format: nil)

audioPlayer.scheduleFile(audioFile, at: nil)
try audioEngine.start()
audioPlayer.play()
```

7. **Dispose and Stop the Audio Engine**

```swift
audioPlayer.stop()
audioEngine.stop()
audioEngine.reset()
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to implement audio time stretching and pitch shifting using Swift and Core Audio. We leveraged the power of AVAudioEngine, AVAudioPlayerNode, AVAudioUnitTimePitch, and AVAudioUnitVarispeed to achieve these audio processing techniques.

By understanding these concepts, you can enhance your audio applications with advanced audio manipulation capabilities. Remember to experiment and fine-tune the parameters to achieve the desired audio effects.
