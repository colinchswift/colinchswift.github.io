## Introduction
Audio playback is a crucial component in many applications, such as music players, podcasts, and voice memos. In this tutorial, we will learn how to implement audio playback in Swift using the AudioPlayer class from the Core Audio framework.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have a basic understanding of the Swift programming language and the Core Audio framework. You should also have Xcode installed on your system.

## Setting up the project
1. Open Xcode and create a new Swift project.
2. Import the Core Audio framework by adding the following line at the top of your Swift file:
```swift
import AVFoundation
```
3. Create an instance of the `AVAudioPlayer` class, which will serve as our audio player:
```swift
var audioPlayer: AVAudioPlayer?
```
4. Initialize the audio player with the audio file you want to play. Replace `"audioFile"` with the name of your audio file:
```swift
guard let audioFilePath = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "audioFile", ofType: "mp3") else {
    print("Audio file not found")
    return
}

do {
    audioPlayer = try AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: URL(fileURLWithPath: audioFilePath))
} catch {
    print("Error initializing audio player")
}
```

## Playing audio
To play the audio, use the `play()` method on the `audioPlayer` instance:
```swift
audioPlayer?.play()
```

## Pausing audio
To pause the audio playback, use the `pause()` method on the `audioPlayer` instance:
```swift
audioPlayer?.pause()
```

## Stopping audio
To stop the audio playback, use the `stop()` method on the `audioPlayer` instance:
```swift
audioPlayer?.stop()
audioPlayer?.currentTime = 0 // Reset the playback position
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to implement audio playback using the AudioPlayer class from the Core Audio framework in Swift. You can further enhance the functionality by adding features like seeking to a specific position, adjusting the volume, or implementing audio playback controls.
