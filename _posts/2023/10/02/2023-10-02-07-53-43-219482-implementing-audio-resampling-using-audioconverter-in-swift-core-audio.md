Resampling audio is a common task in digital signal processing when you need to convert audio between different sample rates. In Swift, you can use the Core Audio framework to perform audio resampling with the help of `AudioConverter`.

In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps to implement audio resampling using `AudioConverter` in Swift.

## Step 1: Setting up the AudioConverter

First, we need to set up the `AudioConverter` instance and its input/output properties. Here's an example of how to do this:

```swift
import AVFoundation

func setupAudioConverter(inputSampleRate: Float64, outputSampleRate: Float64, inputFormat: AudioStreamBasicDescription, outputFormat: AudioStreamBasicDescription) throws -> AudioConverterRef {
    var converter: AudioConverterRef? = nil
    
    let status = AudioConverterNew(&inputFormat, &outputFormat, &converter)
    
    guard status == noErr, let audioConverter = converter else {
        throw NSError(domain: NSOSStatusErrorDomain, code: Int(status))
    }
    
    return audioConverter
}
```
In this example, we create an `AudioConverterRef` instance by calling `AudioConverterNew` with the desired input and output formats. You'll need to provide the input and output sample rates, as well as the audio formats for the input and output streams.

## Step 2: Resampling Audio

Once the `AudioConverter` is set up, we can use it to resample the audio. Here's an example of how to do this:

```swift
import AVFoundation

func resampleAudio(audioConverter: AudioConverterRef, inputData: UnsafeMutableRawPointer, inputLength: Int, outputData: UnsafeMutableRawPointer, outputLength: Int) throws {
    var inPacketDescriptions = [AudioStreamPacketDescription](repeating: AudioStreamPacketDescription(), count: 1)
    var outPacketDescriptions = [AudioStreamPacketDescription](repeating: AudioStreamPacketDescription(), count: 1)
    var outputLength = UInt32(outputLength)
    
    let status = AudioConverterConvertComplexBuffer(audioConverter, UInt32(inputLength), inputData, &outputLength, outputData, &packetDescriptions)
    
    guard status == noErr else {
        throw NSError(domain: NSOSStatusErrorDomain, code: Int(status))
    }
}
```

In this example, we pass the `AudioConverterRef` instance to `AudioConverterConvertComplexBuffer`, along with the input and output data buffers. The function will perform the audio resampling and store the resampled audio in the output buffer.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've learned how to implement audio resampling using `AudioConverter` in Swift. By setting up the `AudioConverter` instance correctly and passing the input and output data buffers, you can easily perform audio resampling in your Swift applications.

Remember to handle any errors that may occur during the resampling process and to check the return status of the `AudioConverter` functions. This will ensure that your audio resampling implementation is reliable and robust.
