With the increasing popularity of audio applications and the need to manipulate audio in real-time, it's important to understand how to implement time-based effects such as time stretching. Time stretching allows you to alter the duration of an audio signal while preserving its original pitch. In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement audio time stretching using Swift and Core Audio.

## What is Time Stretching?

Time stretching is a technique used to manipulate the speed or duration of an audio signal without affecting its pitch. It allows you to slow down or speed up audio playback while maintaining the original tonality of the sound. Time stretching is commonly used in audio applications such as music production, audio editing, and sound design.

## Using AVAudioEngine for Time Stretching

To implement audio time stretching in Swift, we can leverage the power of AVAudioEngine, a high-level audio processing framework provided by Apple. AVAudioEngine provides a rich set of audio functionalities, including time-based effects like time stretching.

Here's an example code snippet that shows how to implement audio time stretching using AVAudioEngine in Swift:

```swift
import AVFoundation

func timeStretchAudio(audioURL: URL, rate: Float) throws {
    let audioFile = try AVAudioFile(forReading: audioURL)
    
    let audioEngine = AVAudioEngine()
    let playerNode = AVAudioPlayerNode()
    let timePitch = AVAudioUnitTimePitch()
    
    timePitch.rate = rate
    
    audioEngine.attach(playerNode)
    audioEngine.attach(timePitch)
    
    audioEngine.connect(playerNode, to: timePitch, fromBus: 0, toBus: 0, format: audioFile.processingFormat)
    audioEngine.connect(timePitch, to: audioEngine.mainMixerNode, fromBus: 0, toBus: 0, format: audioFile.processingFormat)
    
    playerNode.scheduleFile(audioFile, at: nil)
    
    audioEngine.prepare()
    try audioEngine.start()
    
    playerNode.play()
    playerNode.waitUntilPlaying()
    
    while playerNode.isPlaying {
        // Keep the player node running until the audio file finishes playing
    }
    
    audioEngine.stop()
    audioEngine.reset()
}
```

In this example, we define a `timeStretchAudio` function that takes an audio file URL and a time stretch rate as inputs. 

We create an instance of `AVAudioFile` to read the audio file and set up an AVAudioEngine with an AVAudioPlayerNode and an AVAudioUnitTimePitch node. The AVAudioUnitTimePitch node is responsible for applying the time stretch effect to the audio.

We configure the timePitch node by setting its `rate` property to the desired time stretch rate. A rate of 1.0 means no time stretching (normal playback speed), while a rate less than 1.0 slows down the audio and a rate greater than 1.0 speeds up the audio.

Next, we attach the player node and time pitch node to the audio engine and connect them in a series. We schedule the audio file to be played by the player node and start the audio engine.

The player node is then played, and we wait until it starts playing. We keep the player node running until the audio file finishes playing, and then we stop and reset the audio engine.

To use this code, simply pass the URL of the audio file you want to time stretch and the desired rate. For example:

```swift
let audioURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "audio", withExtension: "mp3")!
try timeStretchAudio(audioURL: audioURL, rate: 0.8)
```

This will time stretch the audio file to 80% of its original duration.

## Conclusion

Implementing audio time stretching using time-based effects in Swift Core Audio is made easy with the powerful AVAudioEngine framework. By leveraging AVAudioEngine and the AVAudioUnitTimePitch node, you can manipulate audio playback speed without affecting pitch, opening up a range of possibilities for audio application development. Experiment with different time stretch rates and explore the creative potential of audio time stretching in your projects.
