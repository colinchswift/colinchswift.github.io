Audio resampling is a common technique used in digital signal processing to adjust the sample rate of an audio signal. It can be used for various purposes such as converting audio formats, adjusting playback speed, or synchronizing multiple audio sources. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement audio resampling in Swift using Core Audio framework.

## Understanding Core Audio

Core Audio is Apple's low-level audio framework that provides a set of APIs for working with audio in macOS, iOS, and tvOS applications. It allows developers to perform various audio operations such as recording, playback, mixing, and signal processing.

## Resampling Audio

To resample audio in Swift using Core Audio, we can leverage the `AudioConverter` API. This API allows us to convert audio data from one format to another, including changing the sample rate. Here's an example of how we can use `AudioConverter` to resample audio:

```swift
import AudioToolbox

func resampleAudio(sourceData: Data, sourceSampleRate: Float64, targetSampleRate: Float64) -> Data? {
    guard let sourceAudioBuffer = allocateAudioBuffer(data: sourceData, sampleRate: sourceSampleRate) else {
        return nil
    }
    
    let targetFrameCount = Int((Double(sourceAudioBuffer.frameLength) / sourceSampleRate) * targetSampleRate)
    
    var targetBufferList = AudioBufferList()
    targetBufferList.mNumberBuffers = 1
    targetBufferList.mBuffers.mNumberChannels = sourceAudioBuffer.mBuffers.mNumberChannels
    targetBufferList.mBuffers.mDataByteSize = UInt32(targetFrameCount * sourceAudioBuffer.mBuffers.mNumberChannels * MemoryLayout<Float32>.size)
    targetBufferList.mBuffers.mData = malloc(Int(targetBufferList.mBuffers.mDataByteSize))
    
    let sourceBufferList = UnsafePointer(&sourceAudioBuffer)
    
    var targetFrameCountOutput = UInt32(targetFrameCount)
    
    let audioConverter = AudioConverterRef(bitPattern: 0)
    AudioConverterNew(sourceAudioBuffer.mFormat.mSampleRate,
                      targetSampleRate,
                      targetBufferList.mBuffers.mNumberChannels,
                      sourceAudioBuffer.mFormat,
                      targetBufferList.mBuffers.mNumberChannels,
                      AudioFormatFlags.init(rawValue: 0),
                      &audioConverter)
    
    AudioConverterFillComplexBuffer(audioConverter!,
                                    fillComplexInputDataProc,
                                    sourceBufferList,
                                    &targetFrameCountOutput,
                                    &targetBufferList,
                                    nil)
    
    let targetData = Data(bytes: targetBufferList.mBuffers.mData!, count: Int(targetBufferList.mBuffers.mDataByteSize))
    
    free(targetBufferList.mBuffers.mData)
    
    return targetData
}

func fillComplexInputDataProc(_ inAudioConverter: AudioConverterRef,
                              _ ioNumberDataPackets: UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt32>,
                              _ ioData: UnsafeMutablePointer<AudioBufferList>,
                              _ outDataPacketDescription: UnsafeMutablePointer<Optional<AudioStreamPacketDescription>>,
                              _ inUserData: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?) -> OSStatus {
    // Fill the output buffer with resampled audio data
    return noErr
}

func allocateAudioBuffer(data: Data, sampleRate: Float64) -> AudioBufferList? {
    // Allocate an AudioBufferList from the input data
    return nil
}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to implement audio resampling in Swift using the Core Audio framework. By leveraging the `AudioConverter` API, we can easily adjust the sample rate of an audio signal. This can be useful in various scenarios where audio resampling is required.
