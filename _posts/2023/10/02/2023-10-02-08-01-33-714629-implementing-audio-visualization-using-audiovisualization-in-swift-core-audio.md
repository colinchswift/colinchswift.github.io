In this blog post, we will explore how to implement audio visualization using the `AudioVisualization` framework in Swift Core Audio. 

## What is AudioVisualization?

`AudioVisualization` is a powerful framework that allows developers to create stunning visualizations based on audio input. It provides various visualization styles and options, making it easy to create unique and engaging audio experiences. 

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need:

- Xcode installed on your machine
- Basic knowledge of Swift programming language
- Familiarity with Core Audio concepts

## Step 1: Setup

Start by creating a new Swift project in Xcode. Open Terminal, navigate to the desired directory, and run the following command:

```swift
$ mkdir AudioVisualizationExample
$ cd AudioVisualizationExample
$ swift package init --type executable
$ open Package.swift
```

This will create a new Swift project and open the `Package.swift` file in Xcode.

## Step 2: Add AudioVisualization to your project

Open the `Package.swift` file and add the following dependency:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/tadija/AudioVisualization", from: "3.0.0")
```

Then, add `"AudioVisualization"` to the dependencies array:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourProject",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "AudioVisualization", package: "AudioVisualization")
    ]
),
```

Save the `Package.swift` file and run the following command to fetch the dependencies:

```swift
$ swift package resolve
```

## Step 3: Implement Audio Visualization

Open the `main.swift` file and import the `AudioVisualization` module:

```swift
import AudioVisualization
```

Next, create an instance of `AudioVisualization` and set the audio input source. For example, you can use the microphone input source:

```swift
let audioVisualization = AudioVisualization()
audioVisualization.inputSource = .microphone
```

Now, you can configure the visualization style, options, and other properties as needed. For instance, you can set the visualization style to bar:

```swift
audioVisualization.visualizationStyle = .bar
```

To start the visualization, call the `startVisualization` method:

```swift
audioVisualization.startVisualization()
```

Finally, you can add the visualization view to your interface. Create a new `NSView` or `UIView` instance and add it to your view hierarchy:

```swift
let visualizationView = audioVisualization.visualizationView
yourView.addSubview(visualizationView)
```

## Step 4: Run the Project

Build and run your project using `âŒ˜+R` or by selecting Product > Run from the Xcode menu. You should now see the audio visualization in action based on the chosen visualization style.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to implement audio visualization using the `AudioVisualization` framework in Swift Core Audio. We explored the steps to set up the project, add the `AudioVisualization` dependency, and implement audio visualization in our code. With this knowledge, you can now create captivating visualizations for your audio applications.
