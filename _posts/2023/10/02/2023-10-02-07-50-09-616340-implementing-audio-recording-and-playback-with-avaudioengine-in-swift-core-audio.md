In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement audio recording and playback using AVAudioEngine in the Swift Core Audio framework. AVAudioEngine is a powerful audio processing graph that allows us to manipulate audio in real-time.

## Setup

First, let's start by setting up our project. Open Xcode and create a new Swift project. Next, import the AVFoundation framework by adding the following line to your project's `ViewController.swift` file:

```swift
import AVFoundation
```

## Recording Audio

To record audio, we need to create an instance of the `AVAudioEngine` and `AVAudioFile` classes. We also need to create an `AVAudioInputNode` and connect it to the engine. Here's an example of how to set up the recording functionality:

```swift
// Create an instance of the AVAudioEngine
let audioEngine = AVAudioEngine()

// Create an instance of the AVAudioInputNode
let inputNode = audioEngine.inputNode

// Create an instance of the AVAudioFile
let audioFileURL = // URL for saving the audio file
let audioFile = try AVAudioFile(forWriting: audioFileURL, settings: inputNode.inputFormat(forBus: 0).settings)

// Connect the input node to the engine
audioEngine.attach(inputNode)
audioEngine.connect(inputNode, to: audioEngine.mainMixerNode, format: inputNode.inputFormat(forBus: 0))

// Start the audio engine
try audioEngine.start()

// Start recording
inputNode.installTap(onBus: 0, bufferSize: 4096, format: inputNode.inputFormat(forBus: 0)) { (buffer, time) in
    try? audioFile.write(from: buffer)
}
```

In the code above, we create an instance of the AVAudioEngine and AVAudioInputNode. We then create an AVAudioFile for writing the recorded audio. We connect the input node to the engine and start recording by installing a tap on the input node that writes incoming audio buffers to the audio file.

## Playback Audio

To play back the recorded audio, we need to create an instance of `AVAudioPlayerNode` and connect it to the engine. Here's an example of how to set up the playback functionality:

```swift
// Create an instance of the AVAudioPlayerNode
let playerNode = AVAudioPlayerNode()

// Connect the player node to the engine
audioEngine.attach(playerNode)
audioEngine.connect(playerNode, to: audioEngine.mainMixerNode, format: audioFile.processingFormat)

// Schedule the audio file for playback
playerNode.scheduleFile(audioFile, at: nil)

// Start the audio engine
try audioEngine.start()

// Start playback
playerNode.play()
```

In the code above, we create an instance of the AVAudioPlayerNode and connect it to the engine. We then schedule the audio file for playback and start the audio engine. Finally, we start playback by calling the `play()` method on the player node.

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined above, you can implement audio recording and playback using AVAudioEngine in the Swift Core Audio framework. Whether you're building a music app, a voice memo app, or any other audio-related application, AVAudioEngine provides powerful capabilities for processing and manipulating audio in real-time.
