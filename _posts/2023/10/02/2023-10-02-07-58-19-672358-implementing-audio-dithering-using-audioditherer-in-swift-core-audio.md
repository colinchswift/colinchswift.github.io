When working with audio in Swift using Core Audio, it's important to ensure that the audio quality is maintained. One technique to achieve this is audio dithering, which helps reduce quantization distortion when converting audio from a higher bit depth to a lower bit depth.

To implement audio dithering in Swift using Core Audio, we can make use of the `AudioDitherer` class provided by Apple. Here's how we can do it:

1. Import the necessary frameworks:
```swift
import AudioToolbox
import AudioUnit
```

2. Define a function that will perform audio dithering:
```swift
func applyDitheringToAudio(audioBufferList: UnsafeMutablePointer<AudioBufferList>, inputFormat: AudioStreamBasicDescription, outputFormat: AudioStreamBasicDescription) {
    let ditherer = AudioDitherer()
    
    let sampleCount = audioBufferList.pointee.mBuffers.mDataByteSize / Int(inputFormat.mBytesPerFrame)
    
    // Apply dithering to each audio frame
    for frame in 0..<sampleCount {
        var audioFrames = [Float](repeating: 0, count: Int(inputFormat.mChannelsPerFrame))
        for channel in 0..<Int(inputFormat.mChannelsPerFrame) {
            let audioBufferPointer = audioBufferList.pointee.mBuffers.mData!.bindMemory(to: Float.self, capacity: sampleCount)
            audioFrames[channel] = audioBufferPointer[frame * Int(inputFormat.mChannelsPerFrame) + channel]
        }
        
        let ditheredFrames = ditherer.ditherAudio(frames: audioFrames, from: inputFormat.mBitsPerChannel, to: outputFormat.mBitsPerChannel)
        
        for channel in 0..<Int(outputFormat.mChannelsPerFrame) {
            let audioBufferPointer = audioBufferList.pointee.mBuffers.mData!.bindMemory(to: Float.self, capacity: sampleCount)
            audioBufferPointer[frame * Int(outputFormat.mChannelsPerFrame) + channel] = ditheredFrames[channel]
        }
    }
}
```

3. Set up the audio processing graph and apply dithering to the audio samples:
```swift
let inputFormat = // Set the input audio format
let outputFormat = // Set the output audio format
let audioBufferList: UnsafeMutablePointer<AudioBufferList> = // Get the audio buffer list containing the audio samples

// Set up the audio processing graph

// Apply dithering to the audio samples
applyDitheringToAudio(audioBufferList: audioBufferList, inputFormat: inputFormat, outputFormat: outputFormat)
```

By using the `AudioDitherer` class provided by Apple, we can easily implement audio dithering to maintain the audio quality when converting between different bit depths. This helps to reduce quantization distortion and ensure high-quality audio playback.
