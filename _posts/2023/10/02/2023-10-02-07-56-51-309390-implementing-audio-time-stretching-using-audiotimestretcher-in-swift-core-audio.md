In this blog post, we will explore how to implement audio time stretching using the `AudioTimeStretcher` API in Swift Core Audio. Time stretching is a technique used to change the duration of an audio signal without affecting its pitch. It is commonly used in music production to create different effects or adjust the tempo of a song.

## What is `AudioTimeStretcher`?

`AudioTimeStretcher` is a component provided by Core Audio framework that allows us to adjust the playback speed of an audio stream without changing its pitch. It uses advanced algorithms to stretch or compress audio in real-time, ensuring that the audio maintains its quality and integrity.

## Setting up the project

To get started, create a new Swift project in Xcode:

1. Launch Xcode and select "Create a new Xcode project".
2. Choose "App" under the iOS tab and select "Single View App".
3. Provide a name for your project and choose a location to save it.
4. Make sure to select Swift as the language and Storyboard as the user interface.

Once the project is created, we need to import the Core Audio framework and add the necessary dependencies. From the project navigator, select your project and go to the "Build Phases" tab. Under "Link Binary With Libraries", click the "+" button and add the following frameworks:

- Accelerate.framework
- AVFoundation.framework
- CoreAudio.framework
- CoreMedia.framework

## Implementing audio time stretching

1. Open the `ViewController.swift` file and import the necessary frameworks.

```swift
import AVFoundation
import Accelerate
import CoreMedia
```

2. Add a function to handle audio time stretching. Inside the function, create an instance of `AudioTimeStretcher`.

```swift
func stretchAudio(fileURL: URL) {
    guard let audioFile = try? AVAudioFile(forReading: fileURL) else {
        return
    }

    let audioTimeStretcher = AudioTimeStretcher()
    audioTimeStretcher.prepareForInput(withAudioFile: audioFile)
}
```

3. Specify the desired time stretch factor. A value greater than 1 will stretch the audio, while a value less than 1 will compress it.

```swift
audioTimeStretcher.timeStretchFactor = 1.5 // Stretch audio by 1.5x
```

4. Create an output audio file to store the time-stretched audio.

```swift
let outputURL = FileManager.default.temporaryDirectory.appendingPathComponent("stretchedAudio.caf")
guard let outputSettings = audioTimeStretcher.inputFormat?.settings else {
    return
}

let outputAudioFile = try? AVAudioFile(forWriting: outputURL, settings: outputSettings)
```

5. Process the audio frames using `audioTimeStretcher`.

```swift
let blockSize = 8192
var outputBuffer = AVAudioPCMBuffer(pcmFormat: outputAudioFile?.fileFormat, frameCapacity: AVAudioFrameCount(blockSize))

while true {
    let frameCount = audioTimeStretcher.pullAndProcessAudioFrames(outputBuffer: &outputBuffer)

    if frameCount == 0 {
        break
    }

    try? outputAudioFile?.write(from: outputBuffer)
}
```

6. Finally, don't forget to clean up and close the audio files.

```swift
audioTimeStretcher.reset()
audioTimeStretcher.resetPullAndProcessState()

try? outputAudioFile?.write(from: outputBuffer)
outputAudioFile?.close()
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have explored how to implement audio time stretching using the `AudioTimeStretcher` API in Swift Core Audio. By leveraging the power of Core Audio, we can now manipulate the playback speed of an audio signal without altering its pitch. This allows for the creation of unique audio effects and tempo adjustments, greatly enhancing the possibilities in music production and audio applications.
