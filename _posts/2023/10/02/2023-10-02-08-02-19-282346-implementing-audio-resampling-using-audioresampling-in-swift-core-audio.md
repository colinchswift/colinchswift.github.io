Audio resampling is a crucial task in audio processing, especially when dealing with different sample rates. Resampling allows us to convert audio from one sample rate to another, maintaining audio quality. In this blog post, we'll explore how to implement audio resampling using the `AudioResampling` framework in Swift Core Audio.

## What is AudioResampling?

AudioResampling is a framework provided by Apple as part of the Core Audio APIs. It offers a set of functions and data structures to handle audio resampling efficiently. This framework simplifies the resampling process by providing a high-level abstraction and taking care of the underlying resampling algorithms.

## Adding AudioResampling to your project

To add the `AudioResampling` framework to your Swift project, follow these steps:

1. Open your Xcode project.
2. Go to your project target settings.
3. Under "General", scroll down to the "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" section.
4. Click the "+" button and select "Add Other".
5. Navigate to `/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreAudio.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/AudioToolbox.framework` and select it.

Once you've added the `AudioResampling` framework to your project, you can start using it for audio resampling.

## Resampling audio in Swift

To resample audio using the `AudioResampling` framework, follow these steps:

1. Import the `AudioResampling` framework in your Swift file:

```swift
import AudioResampling
```

2. Create a `AudioConverterRef` object, which represents the audio resampling converter:

```swift
var converter: AudioConverterRef?
// Create the audio converter
_ = AudioConverterNew(nil, &converter)
```

3. Set the source and destination audio format for the converter:

```swift
let sourceAudioFormat = AudioStreamBasicDescription(...)
let destinationAudioFormat = AudioStreamBasicDescription(...)
// Set the source audio format
_ = AudioConverterSetProperty(converter, kAudioConverterCurrentInputStreamDescription, MemoryLayout<AudioStreamBasicDescription>.size, &sourceAudioFormat)
// Set the destination audio format
_ = AudioConverterSetProperty(converter, kAudioConverterCurrentOutputStreamDescription, MemoryLayout<AudioStreamBasicDescription>.size, &destinationAudioFormat)
```

4. Provide input audio data to the converter:

```swift
let inputBuffer = AudioBuffer(...)
// Provide the input audio buffer to the converter
_ = AudioConverterFillComplexBuffer(converter, inputDataProc, &inputBuffer, ...)
```

Here, `inputDataProc` is a callback function that supplies input audio data to the converter. You need to implement this function to read audio data from your source.

5. Retrieve the resampled audio data from the converter:

```swift
let outputBuffer = AudioBuffer(...)
var ioOutputDataPacketSize = UInt32(...)
// Retrieve the resampled audio buffer from the converter
_ = AudioConverterFillComplexBuffer(converter, outputDataProc, &outputBuffer, &ioOutputDataPacketSize, ...)
```

Similar to the input callback function, `outputDataProc` is another callback function that receives the resampled audio data. You need to implement this function to handle the output audio data.

6. Clean up and release resources when finished:

```swift
// Dispose the audio converter
AudioConverterDispose(converter)
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement audio resampling using the `AudioResampling` framework in Swift Core Audio. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily incorporate audio resampling capabilities into your Swift projects. Resampling audio is an essential task when working with different sample rates, and the `AudioResampling` framework simplifies this process significantly.
