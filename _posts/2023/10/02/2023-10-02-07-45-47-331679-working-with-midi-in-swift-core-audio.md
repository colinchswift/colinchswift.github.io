The MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) protocol is widely used in the music industry for connecting different electronic musical instruments, computers, and other devices. In this blog post, we will explore how to work with MIDI using Swift and the Core Audio framework.

## What is Swift Core Audio?

Swift Core Audio is a powerful framework available in the Swift programming language that allows developers to work with low-level audio functionality on macOS, iOS, and other Apple platforms. It provides APIs for working with audio units, audio graphs, audio streams, and MIDI.

## Setting up the Project

Before we start working with MIDI, we need to set up a project in Xcode.

1. Open Xcode and create a new project.
2. Choose the appropriate template for your platform (e.g., iOS, macOS, etc.).
3. Enter a name and other details for the project.
4. Click "Create" to create the project.

## Enabling MIDI Support

To enable MIDI support in your project, follow these steps:

1. In Xcode, select your project from the project navigator.
2. Select your target.
3. Go to the "Capabilities" tab.
4. Enable the "MIDI" capability.
5. If prompted, enable the appropriate background mode(s) for your MIDI usage (e.g., audio, external accessories).

## Working with MIDI

Once MIDI support is enabled, we can start working with MIDI in our Swift code.

### MIDI Input

To receive MIDI messages from an external MIDI device or virtual MIDI port, follow these steps:

```swift
import CoreMIDI

// Get the MIDI client
var client: MIDIClientRef = 0
let status = MIDIClientCreateWithBlock("My MIDI Client") { notificationPtr in
    let notification = notificationPtr.pointee
    // Handle MIDI message
}
```

In the above code, we create a MIDI client using `MIDIClientCreateWithBlock`. The block is called whenever a MIDI message is received. You can handle the MIDI message inside the block.

### MIDI Output

To send MIDI messages to an external MIDI device or virtual MIDI port, follow these steps:

```swift
import CoreMIDI

// Get the MIDI destination
var midiDestination: MIDIEndpointRef = 0
let status = MIDIGetDestination(0, &midiDestination)

// Create the MIDI packet list
var packetList = MIDIPacketList()
var packet = MIDIPacketListInit(&packetList)
packet = MIDIPacketListAdd(&packetList, Int(sizeof(MIDIPacketList)), packet, 0, 3, [0x90, 60, 127])

// Send the MIDI packet list
let status = MIDISend(client, midiDestination, &packetList)
```

In the above code, we get the MIDI destination using `MIDIGetDestination`. We then create a MIDI packet list using `MIDIPacketListInit` and add a MIDI packet to it using `MIDIPacketListAdd`. Finally, we send the MIDI packet list using `MIDISend`.

## Conclusion

Working with MIDI using Swift Core Audio provides a robust and efficient way to handle MIDI messages in your music applications. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can start integrating MIDI functionality into your Swift projects.
