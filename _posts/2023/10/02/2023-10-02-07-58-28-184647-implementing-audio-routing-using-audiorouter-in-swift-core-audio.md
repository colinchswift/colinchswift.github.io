Audio routing is a crucial aspect of audio applications, allowing users to direct audio to specific output devices. In Swift Core Audio, AudioRouter comes to the rescue by providing a simple way to manage audio routing within your app. In this article, we'll explore how to implement audio routing using AudioRouter in Swift Core Audio.

## Setting Up AudioRouter

To get started, you need to add the `AudioRouter` framework to your Xcode project. Follow these steps to add it as a dependency:

1. Open your project in Xcode.
2. Go to **File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency**.
3. Enter the repository URL of AudioRouter: `https://github.com/marcjusz/AudioRouter.git`.
4. Select the latest version and click **Next**.
5. Choose the target where you want to add the dependency and click **Finish**.

## Routing Audio to Output Devices

Once you have added the AudioRouter framework to your project, you can start routing audio to different output devices. Here's an example of how you can do this in Swift:

```swift
import AudioRouter

// Create an instance of AudioRouter
let audioRouter = AudioRouter()

// Check if audio routing is available
if audioRouter.canRoute {
    // Get a list of available output devices
    let outputDevices = audioRouter.outputs

    // Print the available output devices
    for device in outputDevices {
        print(device.name) // e.g., "Built-in Output", "Headphones", etc.
    }

    // Set the audio route to a specific output device
    audioRouter.setOutput(device: outputDevices.first!)

    // Check if the route has been set successfully
    if let currentOutput = audioRouter.currentOutput {
        print("Audio route set to: \(currentOutput.name)") // e.g., "Built-in Output"
    } else {
        print("Failed to set audio route.")
    }
} else {
    print("Audio routing is not available.")
}
```

In the above example, we first create an instance of `AudioRouter`. We then check if audio routing is available using the `canRoute` property. If available, we get a list of output devices using the `outputs` property. After selecting the desired output device, we set it using the `setOutput` method. Finally, we check if the audio route has been set successfully by accessing the `currentOutput` property.

## Conclusion

Implementing audio routing using AudioRouter in Swift Core Audio enables you to provide a seamless audio experience in your application. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can easily route audio to different output devices based on the user's preferences.
