Audio analysis is a crucial component in many audio processing applications. It allows us to extract useful information from audio signals, such as pitch, frequency, amplitude, and more. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement audio analysis using AudioKit, a powerful audio processing framework in Swift, and Core Audio, the low-level audio framework provided by Apple.

## What is AudioKit?

AudioKit is an open-source audio processing toolkit that simplifies audio synthesis, processing, and analysis in iOS, macOS, and tvOS apps. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and APIs for working with audio signals, making it ideal for implementing complex audio processing algorithms.

## Getting Started with AudioKit

To get started, you'll need to install AudioKit in your project. You can do this by adding the following line to your `Podfile`:

```
pod 'AudioKit'
```

After installing AudioKit, import it in your Swift file:

```swift
import AudioKit
```

## Setting up the Audio Engine

Before we can perform audio analysis, we need to set up the audio engine. AudioKit provides an `AKManager` class that handles the audio routing and manages the audio processing nodes.

To set up the audio engine, use the following code:

```swift
AKManager.output = AKMixer()
try AKManager.start()
```

In this example, we set the output of the audio engine to an `AKMixer`, which allows us to mix multiple audio sources together. We then start the audio engine using `AKManager.start()`.

## Adding an Input Node

To perform audio analysis, we need to add an input node to the audio engine. An input node represents the audio source that we want to analyze, such as a microphone input or an audio file.

Here's an example of adding a microphone input as the input node:

```swift
let microphone = AKMicrophone()
AKManager.input = microphone
```

In this example, we create an instance of `AKMicrophone`, which represents the device's microphone input. We then set the input of the audio engine to the microphone using `AKManager.input = microphone`.

## Performing Audio Analysis

Now that we have set up the audio engine and added an input node, we can perform audio analysis on the incoming audio signal using AudioKit's analysis nodes.

For example, to calculate the amplitude of the audio signal, we can use the `AKAmplitudeTracker` node. Here's how to do it:

```swift
let tracker = AKAmplitudeTracker(microphone)
AKManager.output = tracker
```

In this example, we create an instance of `AKAmplitudeTracker` and connect it to the microphone input using `AKAmplitudeTracker(microphone)`. We then set the output of the audio engine to the tracker node.

Once the audio analysis node is set up, you can access the analysis data using the provided properties. For example, to get the current amplitude, you can use `tracker.amplitude`.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement audio analysis using AudioKit and Core Audio in Swift. We learned how to set up the audio engine, add an input node, and perform audio analysis using AudioKit's analysis nodes.

AudioKit provides a wide range of analysis nodes, allowing you to extract various types of information from audio signals. By integrating audio analysis into your applications, you can unlock new possibilities for audio processing and create engaging user experiences.
