Audio playback is a fundamental feature in many applications, such as music players or audio editing tools. In iOS or macOS development, you can leverage the powerful Core Audio framework to implement audio playback functionality. One of the key classes in Core Audio is `AudioPlayback`, which provides an interface for managing and controlling audio playback.

To get started, follow the steps below to implement audio playback using `AudioPlayback` in Swift:

## Step 1: Import the necessary frameworks

First, make sure you import the required frameworks: `CoreAudio`, `AudioToolbox`, and `AVFoundation`.

```swift
import CoreAudio
import AudioToolbox
import AVFoundation
```

## Step 2: Set up the audio session

Before you can start playing audio, you need to set up the audio session. This sets the audio behavior and category for your app.

```swift
let audioSession = AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()
do {
    try audioSession.setCategory(.playback)
    try audioSession.setActive(true)
} catch {
    print("Error setting up audio session: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

## Step 3: Create an instance of `AudioPlayback`

To manage audio playback, create an instance of `AudioPlayback` and configure it with the desired audio file or stream.

```swift
var audioPlayer = AudioPlayback()
do {
    try audioPlayer.open(URL(fileURLWithPath: "path/to/audio/file.mp3"))
} catch {
    print("Error opening audio file: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

## Step 4: Play, pause, and stop audio

Once the audio file is successfully opened, you can control the audio playback using the following methods:

### Play audio

```swift
audioPlayer.play()
```

### Pause audio

```swift
audioPlayer.pause()
```

### Stop audio

```swift
audioPlayer.stop()
```

## Step 5: Handle audio completion

To perform certain actions when the audio playback completes, you can set a completion handler using the `setCompletionHandler` method.

```swift
audioPlayer.setCompletionHandler {
    print("Audio playback completed")
    // Perform additional actions after audio completion
}
```

## Conclusion

Implementing audio playback using `AudioPlayback` in Swift Core Audio is a straightforward process. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily incorporate audio playback functionality into your iOS or macOS applications. Give it a try and enhance your app with the power of audio!
