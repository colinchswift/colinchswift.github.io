Audio streaming is a common feature in many applications, from music player apps to podcast players. In Swift, Core Audio provides a powerful framework to handle consuming and streaming audio. One of the popular libraries built on top of Core Audio is **AudioStreamer**, which simplifies the process of working with audio streams.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to implement audio streaming using **AudioStreamer** in Swift with Core Audio.

## Step 1: Install AudioStreamer

The first step is to install **AudioStreamer** library using Swift package manager. In your Xcode project, navigate to the **File** menu, select **Swift Packages**, then **Add Package Dependency**. Enter the repository URL for **AudioStreamer** (e.g., `https://github.com/drn/audio-streamer.git`) and follow the prompts to complete the installation.

## Step 2: Setup audio session

Before streaming audio, it's important to set up the audio session in the app. This ensures that the audio is played properly and doesn't interfere with other audio in the system. You can do this in the `AppDelegate.swift` file or any other relevant file.

```swift
import AVFoundation

func setupAudioSession() {
    do {
        let session = AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()
        try session.setCategory(.playback)
        try session.setActive(true)
    } catch {
        print("Failed to set up audio session: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}

// Call the setupAudioSession() function before streaming audio
setupAudioSession()
```

## Step 3: Start streaming audio

With the audio session set up, we can now start streaming audio using **AudioStreamer**. Create an instance of the `AudioStreamer` class and pass the audio stream URL to it.

```swift
import AudioStreamer

func startAudioStreaming() {
    guard let audioURL = URL(string: "https://example.com/audio/stream") else {
        print("Invalid audio URL")
        return
    }

    let audioStreamer = AudioStreamer(url: audioURL)
    audioStreamer.play()
}

// Call the startAudioStreaming() function to begin audio streaming
startAudioStreaming()
```

## Step 4: Handle audio streaming events

**AudioStreamer** provides various callbacks to notify the app about different events during audio streaming. You can listen to these callbacks to update your UI or perform additional actions. Here's an example of listening to the `onProgress` event:

```swift
audioStreamer.onProgress = { progress in
    print("Streaming progress: \(progress)")
}

// Add more callbacks to handle other events such as buffering, playback errors, etc.
```

## Conclusion

Implementing audio streaming in your Swift app using **AudioStreamer** makes it easy to fetch and play audio streams. With the power of Core Audio, you can create robust audio player or streaming apps. Remember to properly handle audio session setup and listen to relevant events to provide a seamless audio streaming experience.
