Recording audio is a common feature in many apps, such as voice recording, music recording, or sound effect creation. In Swift, you can use the Core Audio framework to capture audio data from the device's microphone. The `AudioRecording` class provides a simple and efficient way to achieve this. In this blog post, we will learn how to implement audio recording using `AudioRecording` in Swift.

## Step 1: Import the Core Audio framework

The first step is to import the Core Audio framework into your project. You can do this by adding the following line at the top of your Swift file:

```swift
import CoreAudio
```

## Step 2: Create an instance of AudioRecording

To start recording audio, you need to create an instance of the `AudioRecording` class. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
let audioRecording = AudioRecording()
```

## Step 3: Set up audio session

Before you start recording, it's essential to set up the audio session properly. The audio session manages the audio behavior of your app. Add the following code to configure the audio session:

```swift
do {
    try audioRecording.setupAudioSession()
} catch {
    print("Error setting up audio session: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

## Step 4: Prepare for recording

Next, you need to prepare the audio recording. This involves setting up the audio format and the desired output file URL. Here's an example:

```swift
// Set the audio format
audioRecording.audioFormat = AVAudioFormat(standardFormatWithSampleRate: 44100.0, channels: 1)!

// Set the output URL
let documentsDirectory = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)[0]
let outputFileURL = documentsDirectory.appendingPathComponent("recording.wav")
audioRecording.outputURL = outputFileURL
```

Make sure to adjust the sample rate and channel settings according to your requirements.

## Step 5: Start and stop recording

To start the recording, simply call the `startRecording()` method of the `AudioRecording` instance:

```swift
do {
    try audioRecording.startRecording()
} catch {
    print("Error starting recording: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

To stop the recording, call the `stopRecording()` method:

```swift
audioRecording.stopRecording()
```

## Step 6: Handle recording completion

When the recording is finished, you can perform any necessary actions, such as saving the recording, displaying a success message, or playing back the recorded audio. You can use the `audioRecordingDidFinishRecording` delegate method to handle the completion:

```swift
func audioRecordingDidFinishRecording(_ audioRecording: AudioRecording, successfully flag: Bool) {
    if flag {
        print("Recording finished successfully.")
        // Perform actions after recording completion
    } else {
        print("Recording failed.")
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to implement audio recording using the `AudioRecording` class in Swift Core Audio. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily integrate audio recording into your Swift app. Remember to appropriately handle audio session setup, start and stop recording, and handle recording completion. With this knowledge, you can create amazing apps that leverage the power of audio recording.
