Audio routing is an essential feature for many applications that involve audio playback or recording. By properly handling audio routing, you can allow users to select their preferred audio input and output devices, such as headphones, speakers, or external microphones. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement audio routing using the `AudioRouting` framework in Swift Core Audio.

## What is AudioRouting?

The `AudioRouting` framework in the Swift Core Audio library provides a set of APIs to manage audio routing in iOS and macOS applications. It allows you to route audio between different audio input and output devices, as well as control the volume and manipulate other audio parameters.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need:

- Xcode installed on your macOS device.
- A basic understanding of Swift programming language.

## Getting Started

1. Start by creating a new Swift project in Xcode.
2. Import the `AudioToolbox` framework by adding the following line to the top of your Swift file:
```swift
import AudioToolbox
```

## Audio Routing Basics

The first step in implementing audio routing is to obtain the shared audio session instance. The audio session manages the overall audio behavior of your application. For instance, you can configure the audio category (playback, recording, etc.) and audio options.

```swift
let session = AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()
```

Once you have the audio session instance, you can check the available audio input and output routes:

```swift
let availableInputs = session.availableInputs
let availableOutputs = session.currentRoute.outputs
```

You can also set the desired input and output routes using the `setPreferredInput` and `setPreferredOutput` methods:

```swift
let preferredInput = availableInputs.first
try? session.setPreferredInput(preferredInput)
```

```swift
let preferredOutput = availableOutputs.first
try? session.setPreferredOutput(preferredOutput)
```

To activate the new audio routing settings, you need to activate the audio session:

```swift
try? session.setActive(true)
```

## Handling Route Change Notifications

To handle audio route changes in real-time, you can observe the `AVAudioSessionRouteChangeNotification` notification. This notification is triggered whenever the audio input or output route changes.

To register for this notification, add the following code:

```swift
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(handleRouteChange(_:)), name: .AVAudioSessionRouteChange, object: nil)
```

Then implement the `handleRouteChange` method to handle the route change event:

```swift
@objc func handleRouteChange(_ notification: Notification) {
    guard let userInfo = notification.userInfo,
          let reasonValue = userInfo[AVAudioSessionRouteChangeReasonKey] as? UInt,
          let reason = AVAudioSession.RouteChangeReason(rawValue: reasonValue) else {
              return
    }
    
    switch reason {
    case .newDeviceAvailable, .oldDeviceUnavailable:
        // Update the audio routing based on the new available devices
        // or handle the disconnected device.
        break
    default:
        break
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement audio routing using the `AudioRouting` framework in Swift Core Audio. We learned how to obtain the shared audio session, check and set available audio input and output routes, and handle audio route change notifications.

By implementing audio routing in your application, you can provide a more flexible audio experience for your users, allowing them to select their preferred audio input and output devices.
