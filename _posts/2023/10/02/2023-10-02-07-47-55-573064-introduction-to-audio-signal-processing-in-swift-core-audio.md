## What is Swift Core Audio?

Swift Core Audio is a framework that allows developers to work with audio in a low-level manner, providing access to the powerful features of the Core Audio API on Apple devices. With Swift Core Audio, you can easily leverage the underlying audio technologies and perform real-time audio signal processing tasks.

## Setting up Swift Core Audio

To get started with Swift Core Audio, you need to add the framework to your Xcode project. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your Xcode project.
2. Select your project from the Project Navigator.
3. Go to the "General" tab and scroll down to the "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" section.
4. Click the "+" button and select "Add Other...".
5. Browse to the location where the Swift Core Audio framework is located.
6. Select the framework and click "Open".
7. Make sure to set the framework's status to "Optional".

## Basics of Audio Signal Processing with Swift Core Audio

Once you have Swift Core Audio set up in your project, you can start exploring its capabilities for audio signal processing.

### Audio Devices

The first step is to enumerate the available audio devices on the system. You can use the `AudioDevice` class to query and manipulate audio devices. Here's an example of how to get the list of all available devices:

```swift
import CoreAudio

for deviceID in AudioDevice.allDevices() {
    let device = AudioDevice(deviceID: deviceID)

    print("Device Name: \(device.name)")
    print("Manufacturer: \(device.manufacturer)")
    print("Sample Rate: \(device.sampleRate)")
}
```

### Audio Input and Output

To process audio signals, you need to specify the audio inputs and outputs that you want to work with. You can use the `AudioUnit` class to configure the audio input and output units. Here's an example of how to set up an audio input unit and an audio output unit:

```swift
import CoreAudio

let inputUnit = AudioUnit(audioUnitSubType: kAudioUnitSubType_HALOutput, audioUnitType: kAudioUnitType_Output)
let outputUnit = AudioUnit(audioUnitSubType: kAudioUnitSubType_HALOutput, audioUnitType: kAudioUnitType_Output)
```

### Audio Callbacks

In order to process incoming audio data in real-time, you can set up an audio callback function using the `AudioUnitSetRenderCallback` function. Here's a simplified example:

```swift
import CoreAudio

func renderCallback(inRefCon: UnsafeMutableRawPointer,
                    ioActionFlags: UnsafeMutablePointer<AudioUnitRenderActionFlags>,
                    inTimeStamp: UnsafePointer<AudioTimeStamp>,
                    inBusNumber: UInt32,
                    inNumberFrames: UInt32,
                    ioData: UnsafeMutablePointer<AudioBufferList>?) -> OSStatus {
    // Perform audio signal processing here
    return noErr
}

// Set the render callback
AudioUnitSetRenderCallback(outputUnit.audioUnit, renderCallback, nil)
```

### Audio Effects

One of the powerful features of audio signal processing is the ability to apply various effects to audio signals. Swift Core Audio provides a range of audio processing units (AudioUnits) that you can use to apply effects like reverb, delay, EQ, and more. Here's an example of how to create and configure an audio processing unit:

```swift
import CoreAudio

let reverbUnit = AudioUnit(audioUnitSubType: kAudioUnitSubType_Reverb2, audioUnitType: kAudioUnitType_Effect)
reverbUnit.setParameter(kAudioUnitProperty_SubType,
                        value: kAudioUnitSubType_Hall,
                        scope: kAudioUnitScope_Global)
```
