Are you looking to implement audio processing in your Swift app? Look no further! AudioKit, a powerful audio processing framework, makes it easy to work with audio in Swift Core Audio. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of setting up and implementing audio processing using AudioKit in your Swift app.

## Step 1: Setting Up AudioKit

Start by adding AudioKit to your project. You can use CocoaPods, Carthage, or manually add the framework to your project. Import AudioKit in your project's Swift file:

```swift
import AudioKit
```

Next, initialize AudioKit and set up the audio session. In your app's delegate, add the following code to initialize AudioKit and configure the audio session:

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    // Initialize AudioKit
    AudioKit.output = AKManager.sharedInstance.engine.outputNode
    
    // Configure the audio session
    do {
        try AKManager.sharedInstance.start()
    } catch {
        print("AudioKit did not start!")
    }
    
    return true
}
```

## Step 2: Creating Audio Processing Nodes

Now that we have AudioKit set up, let's create audio processing nodes. You can use various nodes available in AudioKit to manipulate audio. For example, let's create a simple delay effect using the `AKDelay` node:

```swift
let input = AKStereoInput()
let delay = AKDelay(input)
```

In this example, `input` is the source of audio and `delay` applies a delay effect to the input audio.

## Step 3: Connecting Audio Nodes

Once we have our audio processing nodes, we need to connect them to form an audio processing chain. You can connect multiple nodes using the `connect` method. For example, let's connect our `delay` node to the output:

```swift
delay.connect(to: AudioKit.output)
```

In this case, the output of the `delay` node is connected to the app's audio output.

## Step 4: Start and Stop Audio Processing

Finally, let's start and stop the audio processing when needed. You can use the `start()` and `stop()` methods to control the audio processing. For example:

```swift
// Start audio processing
AKManager.sharedInstance.start()

// Stop audio processing
AKManager.sharedInstance.stop()
```

You can incorporate these start and stop methods into your app's user interface or trigger audio processing based on specific events in your app.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we walked you through the process of implementing audio processing using AudioKit in Swift Core Audio. We covered setting up AudioKit, creating audio processing nodes, connecting the nodes, and starting and stopping audio processing. With AudioKit, you have access to a powerful audio processing framework in Swift, enabling you to create impressive audio effects and functionality in your apps.
