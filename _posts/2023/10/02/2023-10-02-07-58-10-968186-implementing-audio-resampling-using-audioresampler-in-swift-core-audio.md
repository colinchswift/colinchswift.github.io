The process of audio resampling involves changing the sampling rate of an audio signal. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as converting audio files to different sample rates or adapting audio streams to match the desired output device. In Swift Core Audio, we can utilize the `AudioResampler` class to achieve audio resampling with ease. 

To get started, let's take a look at an example implementation that resamples an audio file from a source sample rate to a target sample rate using the `AudioResampler` class.

## Setting Up the Project

To begin, make sure you have the Swift Core Audio framework installed in your project. You can do this by adding the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'SwiftCoreAudio'
```

After running `pod install`, you can start implementing the audio resampling functionality.

## Opening the Audio File

The first step is to open the audio file that needs to be resampled. We can use the `AudioFile` class from Swift Core Audio to achieve this. Here's an example of how to open an audio file:

```swift
import SwiftCoreAudio

guard let audioFile = try? AudioFile(url: audioURL) else {
    // Handle error while opening the audio file
    return
}
```

## Creating the Resampler

Once the audio file is opened, we can create an instance of the `AudioResampler` class. The `AudioResampler` takes the source audio format and the target audio format as parameters. In this example, we are resampling from a source sample rate of 44100 Hz to a target sample rate of 48000 Hz:

```swift
let sourceSampleRate = audioFile.fileFormat.sampleRate
let targetSampleRate: Float64 = 48000

guard let resampler = AudioResampler(sourceSampleRate: sourceSampleRate, targetSampleRate: targetSampleRate) else {
    // Handle error while creating the resampler
    return
}
```

## Processing Audio Frames

Now that we have the audio file opened and the resampler created, we can start processing the audio frames. We need to read audio frames from the source file and pass them through the resampler to get the resampled frames. Here's an example of how to perform this operation:

```swift
let frameCount: UInt32 = 4096
var inputBuffer: [Float32] = Array(repeating: 0, count: Int(frameCount) * Int(audioFile.fileFormat.channelCount))
var outputBuffer: [Float32] = Array(repeating: 0, count: Int(frameCount) * Int(resampler.targetFormat.channelCount))

while true {
    let framesRead = try audioFile.read(into: &inputBuffer, frameCount: frameCount)
    
    if framesRead == 0 {
        // Reached end of the audio file
        break
    }
    
    guard let resampledFrames = try resampler.resample(frames: inputBuffer, frameCount: frameCount) else {
        // Handle error while resampling
        break
    }
    
    // Do something with the resampled frames (e.g., write to another audio file)
    // ...
}
```

## Closing the Audio File

Finally, after we have processed all the audio frames, it's important to close the audio file to release any allocated resources. We can do this by calling the `close()` method on the `AudioFile` instance:

```swift
audioFile.close()
```

## Conclusion

By utilizing the `AudioResampler` class in Swift Core Audio, we can easily implement audio resampling in our applications. This allows us to adapt audio signals to different sampling rates and achieve the desired audio quality. Remember to handle any errors that may occur during the process and close the audio file after processing.
