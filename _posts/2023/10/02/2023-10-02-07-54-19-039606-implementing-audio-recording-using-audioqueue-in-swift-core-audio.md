Audio recording is a common feature in many applications, allowing users to capture and share audio content. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement audio recording using AudioQueue in Swift Core Audio.

## What is AudioQueue?

AudioQueue is a low-level audio API provided by Core Audio framework in iOS and macOS. It allows developers to perform audio input and output operations, such as recording and playing audio. With AudioQueue, you have fine-grained control over the audio processing pipeline, making it suitable for advanced audio applications.

## Setting up the project

To begin, create a new Swift project in Xcode. Open a new Swift file where we will write the code for audio recording.

## Recording audio

To record audio using AudioQueue, we need to follow a series of steps:

1. Configure audio session: Before recording, we need to configure the audio session by setting the appropriate category and activating it.

2. Create an audio queue: We initialize an instance of AudioQueue using `AudioQueueNewInput` function. This creates an input audio queue for recording audio.

3. Set audio format: Next, we set the desired audio format for recording using `AudioQueueSetProperty` function. This includes specifying sample rate, number of channels, and the audio format ID.

4. Allocate audio buffers: We allocate audio buffers using `AudioQueueAllocateBuffer` function to store the recorded audio data.

5. Set input callback: We set the input callback function using `AudioQueueSetProperty` to receive the recorded audio data.

6. Start audio queue: Finally, we start the audio queue using `AudioQueueStart` to begin recording audio.

```swift
// Configure audio session
let audioSession = AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()
try? audioSession.setCategory(.playAndRecord)
try? audioSession.setActive(true)

// Create audio queue
var audioQueue: AudioQueueRef?
AudioQueueNewInput(&audioStreamDescription, inputCallback, nil, nil, nil, 0, &audioQueue)

// Set audio format
AudioQueueSetProperty(audioQueue!, kAudioQueueProperty_StreamFormat, &audioStreamDescription, UInt32(MemoryLayout.size(ofValue: audioStreamDescription)))

// Allocate audio buffers
guard let audioQueue = audioQueue else { return }
for _ in 0..<kNumberOfAudioBuffers {
    var audioBuffer: AudioQueueBufferRef?
    AudioQueueAllocateBuffer(audioQueue, bufferSize, &audioBuffer)
    AudioQueueEnqueueBuffer(audioQueue, audioBuffer, 0, nil)
}

// Set input callback
AudioQueueSetProperty(audioQueue, kAudioQueueProperty_DataSource, kAudioQueueProperty_SpeakerConfiguration, 0)

// Start audio queue
AudioQueueStart(audioQueue, nil)
```

## Handling recorded audio data

To receive the recorded audio data, we need to implement the input callback function. This function gets called whenever the audio queue has recorded audio data available. In the input callback function, we can process the audio data as per our requirements.

```swift
func inputCallback(
    inUserData: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?,
    inAQ: AudioQueueRef,
    inBuffer: AudioQueueBufferRef,
    inStartTime: UnsafePointer<AudioTimeStamp>,
    inNumPackets: UInt32,
    inPacketDescription: UnsafePointer<AudioStreamPacketDescription>?
) {
    // Process recorded audio data here
}

// ...

// Set input callback function
AudioQueueSetProperty(audioQueue, kAudioQueueProperty_SetOutputCallback, &inputCallback, nil)
```

## Wrapping up

In this blog post, we learned how to implement audio recording using AudioQueue in Swift Core Audio. We covered the steps required to configure the audio session, create an audio queue for recording, set the audio format, allocate audio buffers, set the input callback function, and start the audio queue.

Implementing audio recording using AudioQueue provides us with fine-grained control over the audio processing pipeline. With further processing and handling of the recorded audio data, we can create powerful audio recording features in our applications.
