Swift Core Audio provides a powerful framework for working with audio in iOS and macOS applications. One of its key features is the `AudioAnalyzer` class, which allows us to perform real-time audio analysis on input audio data. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement audio analysis using `AudioAnalyzer` in Swift.

## Setting up the AudioAnalyzer

To begin, we need to set up the `AudioAnalyzer` instance in our application. We will start by creating an instance of `AudioAnalyzer` and specifying the desired audio format for analysis.

```swift
import CoreAudio

// Set up the audio format for analysis
var audioFormat = AudioStreamBasicDescription()
audioFormat.mSampleRate = 44100.0
audioFormat.mFormatID = kAudioFormatLinearPCM
audioFormat.mFormatFlags = kLinearPCMFormatFlagIsFloat
audioFormat.mFramesPerPacket = 1
audioFormat.mChannelsPerFrame = 1
audioFormat.mBitsPerChannel = 32
audioFormat.mBytesPerFrame = audioFormat.mChannelsPerFrame * (audioFormat.mBitsPerChannel / 8)
audioFormat.mBytesPerPacket = audioFormat.mBytesPerFrame * audioFormat.mFramesPerPacket

// Create the AudioAnalyzer instance
var audioAnalyzer: AudioAnalyzer? = AudioAnalyzer(audioFormat: audioFormat)
```

In the above code, we are setting up the audio format with a sample rate of 44100 Hz, single channel, and 32 bits per channel.

## Processing the Audio Data

Once we have set up the `AudioAnalyzer` instance, we can start processing the incoming audio data. We will associate a callback function with the `AudioAnalyzer` instance, which will be called whenever new audio data is available for analysis.

```swift
// Callback function for processing audio data
func audioDataCallback(audioData: UnsafeMutablePointer<Float32>, frameCount: UInt32) {
    guard let analyzer = audioAnalyzer else {
        return
    }
    
    // Analyze the audio data
    let result = analyzer.analyze(audioData: audioData, frameCount: frameCount)
    
    // Process the analysis result
    // ...
}

// Set the callback function for audio data processing
audioAnalyzer?.setAudioDataCallback(audioDataCallback)
```

In the `audioDataCallback` function, we retrieve the `AudioAnalyzer` instance using optional binding. We then call the `analyze` method of `AudioAnalyzer` to perform the actual analysis on the provided audio data. The analysis result can be further processed as per requirements.

## Starting and Stopping the Audio Analysis

To start and stop the audio analysis, we need to utilize the `AudioAnalyzer` methods `startAnalysis` and `stopAnalysis`.

```swift
// Start the audio analysis
audioAnalyzer?.startAnalysis()

// Stop the audio analysis
audioAnalyzer?.stopAnalysis()
```

We can call these methods at appropriate places in our application to start and stop the audio analysis as required.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to implement audio analysis using the `AudioAnalyzer` class in Swift Core Audio. We set up the `AudioAnalyzer` instance, processed the received audio data using a callback function, and started and stopped the audio analysis as needed. With this knowledge, you can now integrate real-time audio analysis capabilities into your iOS or macOS applications.
