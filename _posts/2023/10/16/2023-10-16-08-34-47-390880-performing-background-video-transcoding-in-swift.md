Transcoding videos is a common task in many iOS applications. However, it can be a time-consuming task, especially for large video files. To ensure a smooth user experience, it's best to perform video transcoding in the background.

In this blog post, we will explore how to perform background video transcoding using Swift. We will leverage the power of Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) to execute the transcoding process on a separate background queue.

## Introduction
Video transcoding involves converting an input video file into another format or adjusting its properties like resolution, frame rate, or quality. This process is typically resource-intensive and can impact the performance of the main application if performed on the main thread.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you should have basic knowledge of Swift and iOS development. Additionally, you should have Xcode installed on your machine.

## Transcoding Video
Before diving into the background transcoding implementation, let's first discuss the video transcoding process itself. There are various libraries available for transcoding videos in Swift, such as AVFoundation and FFMpegKit.

For this example, we will use the AVFoundation framework, which is built-in on iOS and provides comprehensive APIs for working with multimedia assets. AVFoundation allows us to read, write, and process media files efficiently.

Assuming you already have a video file URL, the basic steps for transcoding a video using AVFoundation are as follows:

1. Create an `AVAsset` instance from the video file URL.
2. Create an `AVAssetExportSession` instance to perform the transcoding.
3. Set the desired output file format, output file URL, and other export settings.
4. Start the export session using `exportAsynchronously(completionHandler:)` method.
5. Monitor the progress and handle the completion in the completion handler.

## Dispatch Queue
Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) is a powerful mechanism in Swift that allows us to perform tasks concurrently and asynchronously. It provides a simple way to manage and schedule tasks on different queues.

In our case, we will use a background queue to perform the transcoding process. This ensures that the main thread remains responsive and the user can continue to interact with the application while the video is being transcoded.

## Implementing Background Transcoding
Now, let's see how we can combine the video transcoding process and the dispatch queue to perform background transcoding in Swift.

First, import the AVFoundation framework into your Swift file:

```swift
import AVFoundation
```

Next, define a method that performs the transcoding process. This method should take the input video file URL and the desired output file URL as parameters. Inside this method, create an `AVAssetExportSession` instance and configure it with the desired output settings:

```swift
func transcodeVideo(inputURL: URL, outputURL: URL) {
    let asset = AVAsset(url: inputURL)
    let exportSession = AVAssetExportSession(asset: asset, presetName: AVAssetExportPresetMediumQuality)
    exportSession?.outputURL = outputURL
    exportSession?.outputFileType = AVFileType.mp4 // Output file format
    exportSession?.shouldOptimizeForNetworkUse = true

    // Other export settings can be configured here

    exportSession?.exportAsynchronously(completionHandler: {
        // Handle export completion or error here
        if exportSession?.status == .completed {
            // Transcoding successful
        } else if exportSession?.status == .failed {
            // Transcoding failed
        } else if exportSession?.status == .cancelled {
            // Transcoding cancelled
        } else {
            // Transcoding in progress
        }
    })
}
```

To perform the transcoding process in the background, define a method that creates a background queue using GCD and calls the `transcodeVideo` method:

```swift
func performBackgroundTranscoding() {
    let videoInputURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/input/video.mov")
    let videoOutputURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/output/video.mp4")

    DispatchQueue.global().async {
        self.transcodeVideo(inputURL: videoInputURL, outputURL: videoOutputURL)
    }
}
```

Finally, you can call the `performBackgroundTranscoding` method whenever you need to start the video transcoding process. This will ensure that the transcoding happens in the background, so your application remains responsive.

## Conclusion
Performing background video transcoding in Swift is crucial to maintain a smooth user experience in your iOS applications. By leveraging Grand Central Dispatch and the AVFoundation framework, you can easily implement this functionality and keep your main thread responsive.

In this blog post, we discussed the basic steps involved in video transcoding using AVFoundation and how to perform it in the background using GCD. Feel free to explore further and customize the transcoding settings to fit your specific requirements.
