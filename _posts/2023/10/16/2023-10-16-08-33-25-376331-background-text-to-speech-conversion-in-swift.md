In this blog post, we will explore how to add background text-to-speech conversion in Swift. Text-to-speech (TTS) technology has become increasingly popular due to its ability to convert written text into spoken words. It can be used in various scenarios, such as accessibility features, language learning apps, and voice assistants.

## Why use background text-to-speech conversion?

When implementing TTS functionality, it is important to consider the user experience. By performing text-to-speech conversion in the background, you can allow users to perform other tasks while the text is being spoken. This enhances usability and ensures that users can multitask without interruptions.

## Using AVSpeechSynthesizer for background text-to-speech conversion

Swift provides the AVSpeechSynthesizer class, which allows us to seamlessly convert text to speech. To perform background text-to-speech conversion, we need to enable the audio session in the background. Here's an example code snippet:

```swift
import AVFoundation

func convertTextToSpeech(text: String) {
    let synthesizer = AVSpeechSynthesizer()
    let utterance = AVSpeechUtterance(string: text)
    
    if #available(iOS 13.0, *) {
        if synthesizer.isPaused || synthesizer.isSpeaking {
            synthesizer.stopSpeaking(at: .immediate)
        }

        try? AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setCategory(.playback, mode: .default, options: [.allowBluetooth, .mixWithOthers])
        try? AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setActive(true, options: .notifyOthersOnDeactivation)
    } else {
        try? AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setCategory(.playback, options: .mixWithOthers)
        try? AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setActive(true)
    }
    
    synthesizer.speak(utterance)
}
```

In the above code, we first create an instance of `AVSpeechSynthesizer`, which handles the actual text-to-speech conversion. We then create an `AVSpeechUtterance` object with the desired text to be spoken.

Next, we check the iOS version to handle the audio session configuration accordingly. For iOS 13 and above, we use the new API, which allows mixing speech with other audio, such as background music or phone calls. For older versions, we set the audio category to allow mixing with other audio.

Finally, we call `speak()` on the synthesizer instance to start the text-to-speech conversion.

## Conclusion

By performing background text-to-speech conversion in Swift using AVSpeechSynthesizer, we can create a seamless user experience that allows users to multitask while listening to spoken text. This feature can greatly enhance the accessibility and usability of your application.
