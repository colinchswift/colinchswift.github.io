Sending emails is a common feature in many Swift applications. However, users often experience a delay in their application's responsiveness when sending emails. To overcome this issue, developers can implement background email sending, which allows the email sending process to run asynchronously in the background, freeing up the main thread for other tasks.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement background email sending in Swift applications, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Background Email Sending

By default, email sending in Swift applications is a synchronous process that blocks the main thread until the email is sent. This can lead to a perceived lag in the application's responsiveness, especially when sending large attachments or in cases with slow network connectivity.

To alleviate this issue, we can offload the email sending process to a background thread, allowing the user interface to remain responsive while the email is being sent in the background.

## Steps to Implement Background Email Sending

**Step 1: Set up an Email Service**
Firstly, we need to set up an email service provider or utilize an existing email service such as Gmail, Outlook, or SendGrid. You will need to have the necessary credentials and API keys to send emails using this service.

**Step 2: Configure Background Task**
Next, configure a background task for sending emails. iOS provides a specific background execution mode called `backgroundTask` that allows us to run tasks in the background for a limited time.

**Step 3: Move Email Sending to the Background Thread**
Move the actual email sending code to a background thread using either GCD (Grand Central Dispatch) or `OperationQueue`. This ensures that the email sending process runs asynchronously, freeing up the main thread.

**Step 4: Handle Completion**
Handle the completion of the email sending process by either presenting a success/failure notification to the user or storing the status for future reference.

## Example Code

```swift
import Foundation
import MessageUI

func sendEmailInBackground(to recipient: String, subject: String, body: String, attachment: Data? = nil) {
    guard MFMailComposeViewController.canSendMail() else {
        print("Cannot send email")
        return
    }
    
    let mail = MFMailComposeViewController()
    mail.mailComposeDelegate = self
    mail.setToRecipients([recipient])
    mail.setSubject(subject)
    mail.setMessageBody(body, isHTML: false)
    
    if let attachmentData = attachment {
        mail.addAttachmentData(attachmentData, mimeType: "application/octet-stream", fileName: "attachment")
    }
    
    DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background).async {
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            UIApplication.shared.delegate?.window??.rootViewController?.present(mail, animated: true, completion: nil)
        }
        
        UIApplication.shared.beginBackgroundTask(expirationHandler: nil)
    }
}

extension ViewController: MFMailComposeViewControllerDelegate {
    func mailComposeController(_ controller: MFMailComposeViewController, didFinishWith result: MFMailComposeResult, error: Error?) {
        controller.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
        
        // Handle the completion here
    }
}
```

In the above example, we create a function `sendEmailInBackground` that accepts the recipient, subject, body, and an optional attachment as parameters. The function configures a `MFMailComposeViewController` and presents it in the application's window using the background thread. The completion of the email sending process is handled in the `MFMailComposeViewControllerDelegate` extension.

## Conclusion

By implementing background email sending in Swift applications, we can ensure a smoother user experience by offloading the email sending process to a background thread. This allows the application's main thread to remain responsive, providing a more seamless interaction for the user.

By following the steps mentioned above and utilizing the provided example code, you can incorporate background email sending within your Swift applications and enhance the overall performance and responsiveness.
