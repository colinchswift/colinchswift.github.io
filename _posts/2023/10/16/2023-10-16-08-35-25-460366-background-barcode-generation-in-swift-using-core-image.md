Barcode generation is a common requirement in many applications, such as inventory management, ticketing systems, and loyalty programs. In this tutorial, we will learn how to generate barcodes in the background using Swift and Core Image framework.

## Introduction

Core Image is a powerful framework provided by Apple to perform image processing tasks efficiently. It includes built-in support for generating various types of barcodes, such as Code128, QR codes, and PDF417. By using Core Image, we can easily generate barcodes without relying on third-party libraries or web services.

## Setting up the Project

To get started, create a new Swift project in Xcode. Open the Terminal and navigate to the project's directory. Run the following command to initialize a new `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod init
```

Open the `Podfile` and add the following dependency:

```ruby
pod 'CoreImage'
```

Save the `Podfile` and run `pod install` in the Terminal to install the Core Image library. Close the Xcode project and open the newly generated `.xcworkspace` file.

## Generating Barcodes

Open the `ViewController.swift` file and import the CoreImage framework:

```swift
import CoreImage
```

In the `viewDidLoad` method, add the following code to generate a barcode:

```swift
guard let filter = CIFilter(name: "CICode128BarcodeGenerator") else {
    print("Could not create CIFilter")
    return
}

let data = "12345".data(using: .ascii)
filter.setValue(data, forKey: "inputMessage")

guard let image = filter.outputImage else {
    print("Could not generate barcode")
    return
}

let context = CIContext()
let cgImage = context.createCGImage(image, from: image.extent)
let barcodeImage = UIImage(cgImage: cgImage)
```

This code creates a `CICode128BarcodeGenerator` filter, sets the input message to "12345", generates the barcode image using Core Image, and converts it into a `UIImage`.

## Running the Generation Process in the Background

To run the barcode generation process in the background, we will use the `DispatchQueue` to perform the heavy work asynchronously. Add the following method to the `ViewController` class:

```swift
private func generateBarcodeInBackground() {
    DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async {
        // Generate barcode code here
        
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            // Update the UI with the generated barcode image
        }
    }
}
```
In the `viewDidLoad` method, call the `generateBarcodeInBackground` method to initiate the barcode generation:

```swift
generateBarcodeInBackground()
```

This ensures that the barcode generation process is run on a background queue, keeping the UI responsive.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to generate barcodes in the background using Swift and Core Image framework. We explored how to set up the project, generate barcodes using Core Image filters, and run the generation process in the background to keep the UI responsive. Now you can incorporate barcode generation into your apps easily and efficiently.
