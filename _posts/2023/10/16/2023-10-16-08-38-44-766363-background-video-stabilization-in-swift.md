In this blog post, we will explore how to implement background video stabilization in Swift using the Core Image framework. Video stabilization is a common technique used to reduce shakiness in videos, providing a smoother and more professional look. By stabilizing videos in the background, we can enhance user experience and improve the overall quality of our iOS apps.

## Introduction

Video stabilization involves adjusting the position and rotation of frames in a video to compensate for camera movement and eliminate shake. Traditionally, video stabilization is performed in real-time during video playback, which can be resource-intensive and impact the app's performance.

To overcome this limitation, we can leverage the power of **Core Image**, a powerful framework provided by Apple for image and video processing. Core Image allows us to apply advanced filters and effects, including video stabilization, to videos without affecting the real-time playback.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Xcode installed on your macOS machine.
- Basic knowledge of Swift programming language and iOS development.
- A sample video file to test the stabilization process.

## Implementing Background Video Stabilization

To implement background video stabilization in Swift, we'll follow these steps:

1. Load the video asset from a file using `AVAsset`.
2. Create an `AVMutableComposition` to hold the video track.
3. Apply video stabilization using Core Image's `CIFilter`.
4. Export the stabilized video to a new file using `AVAssetExportSession`.

```swift
import AVFoundation
import CoreImage

func stabilizeVideo(at url: URL, outputURL: URL, completion: @escaping (Error?) -> Void) {
    let asset = AVAsset(url: url)
    guard let videoTrack = asset.tracks(withMediaType: .video).first else {
        completion(nil)
        return
    }
    
    let composition = AVMutableComposition()
    let compositionVideoTrack = composition.addMutableTrack(withMediaType: .video, preferredTrackID: kCMPersistentTrackID_Invalid)
    
    do {
        try compositionVideoTrack?.insertTimeRange(CMTimeRangeMake(start: .zero, duration: asset.duration), of: videoTrack, at: .zero)
    } catch {
        completion(error)
        return
    }
    
    let filter = CIFilter(name: "CIVideoStabilization")
    let stabilizedVideoTrack = compositionVideoTrack?.copy(with: nil) as? AVMutableCompositionTrack
    
    let adaptor = AVAssetReaderTrackOutput(track: videoTrack, outputSettings: nil)
    
    do {
        try filter?.setValue(adaptor, forKey: "input")
        try filter?.setValue(stabilizedVideoTrack, forKey: "output")
        try filter?.setValue(NSNumber(value: 1), forKey: "disableTemporalAnalysis")
        try filter?.setValue(nil, forKey: "motion")
        try filter?.setValue(nil, forKey: "borders")
    } catch {
        completion(error)
        return
    }
    
    let exporter = AVAssetExportSession(asset: composition, presetName: AVAssetExportPresetHighestQuality)
    exporter?.outputFileType = .mp4
    exporter?.outputURL = outputURL
    
    exporter?.exportAsynchronously(completionHandler: {
        if let error = exporter?.error {
            completion(error)
        } else {
            completion(nil)
        }
    })
}
```

In the code above, we first load the video asset using `AVAsset` and extract the video track. Then, we create an `AVMutableComposition` to store the video track and add the video track to the composition.

Next, we create a `CIFilter` with the name "CIVideoStabilization" for video stabilization. We set up the filter by providing the input and output tracks, disabling temporal analysis, and setting the motion and borders values to `nil`.

Finally, we use `AVAssetExportSession` to export the stabilized video to a new file. We set the output file type to `.mp4` and specify the output URL. The export process runs asynchronously and the completion handler will be called once the export is complete.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to implement background video stabilization in Swift using the Core Image framework. By leveraging Core Image's powerful video processing capabilities, we can easily stabilize videos in the background, providing a smoother and more professional look to our iOS apps.

Video stabilization is just one of the many ways Core Image can enhance our image and video processing workflows. Be sure to explore the Core Image documentation and experiment with different filters and effects to take your iOS apps to the next level.
