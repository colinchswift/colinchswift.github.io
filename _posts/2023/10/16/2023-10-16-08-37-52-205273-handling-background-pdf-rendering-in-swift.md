In this blog post, we will discuss how to handle background PDF rendering in Swift using the Core Graphics framework. Rendering PDF documents in the background can be beneficial for performance reasons, as it allows your application to continue responding to user interactions while the rendering process takes place.

## Introduction
PDF rendering typically involves complex operations that can result in a delay, especially when dealing with large documents. By performing the rendering process in the background, you can prevent the user interface from freezing or becoming unresponsive.

## Setting up the project
To get started, create a new Swift project in Xcode. Import the Core Graphics framework by adding the following import statement at the top of your Swift file:

```swift
import PDFKit
```

## Rendering a PDF in the background
To render a PDF document in the background, you can use the `PDFDocument` class provided by the `PDFKit` framework. The following code snippet demonstrates how to initiate the rendering process:

```swift
let pdfDocument = PDFDocument(url: PDFURL)
let layout = PDFPageLayout.singlePageContinuous
let bounds = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 500, height: 500)

DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background).async {
    pdfDocument?.write(to: fileURL, withOptions: [
        PDFDocumentWriteOption.pageLayout: layout.rawValue,
        PDFDocumentWriteOption.bounds: NSValue(cgRect: bounds)
    ])
}
```

In this code, we create an instance of `PDFDocument` using the URL of the PDF file we want to render. We then specify the desired layout and bounds for the rendered pages. Finally, we use a background queue provided by Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) to asynchronously perform the rendering process.

## Monitoring the rendering progress
To monitor the progress of the rendering process, you can use the `progress` property of the `PDFDocument` class. Here's an example of how to display a progress bar while the rendering is in progress:

```swift
let progressBar = UIProgressView(progressViewStyle: .default)
progressBar.progress = 0.0

DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background).async {
    let pdfDocument = PDFDocument(url: PDFURL)
    pdfDocument?.delegate = self

    pdfDocument?.write(to: fileURL, withOptions: [
        PDFDocumentWriteOption.pageLayout: layout.rawValue,
        PDFDocumentWriteOption.bounds: NSValue(cgRect: bounds)
    ])
}

extension ViewController: PDFDocumentDelegate {
    func didMatchString(_ instance: PDFSelection) {
        let progress = Float(instance.pages.count) / Float(pdfDocument.pageCount)
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            progressBar.progress = progress
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `UIProgressView` instance to display the progress of the PDF rendering. Inside the delegate method `didMatchString`, we calculate the progress based on the number of pages rendered and update the progress bar on the main queue.

## Conclusion
Handling background PDF rendering is essential for ensuring a smooth user experience in applications that deal with PDF documents. By leveraging the Core Graphics framework and performing the rendering process in the background, you can prevent your app's user interface from freezing or becoming unresponsive. This can greatly enhance the overall usability of your application.
