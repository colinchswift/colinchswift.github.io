Face detection is a common feature in many mobile applications, especially those involving image analysis and biometrics. However, performing face detection in real-time while the camera is actively capturing frames can be computationally intensive and impact the performance of your application.

To address this issue, one possible solution is to implement face detection in the background using Swift. This allows the face detection algorithm to run independently of the application's main thread, ensuring a smoother and more responsive user experience.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement background face detection in Swift using the Vision framework available in iOS.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you will need:

1. Xcode installed on your Mac.
2. A basic understanding of Swift programming.

## Step 1: Set up the project
Start by creating a new Swift project in Xcode. Choose a single view application template, and give it an appropriate name. 

## Step 2: Import Vision framework
In your project navigator, select the project file, and navigate to the "Linked Frameworks and Libraries" section. Click the "+" button to add a new framework and select "Vision.framework" from the list.

## Step 3: Create a Vision request
Open the ViewController.swift file and import the Vision framework with the following line of code:

```swift
import Vision
```

Next, create a new function called `performFaceDetection` inside the ViewController class:

```swift
func performFaceDetection(on image: UIImage) {
    guard let cgImage = image.cgImage else { return }
    
    let faceDetectionRequest = VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest { request, error in
        guard let observations = request.results as? [VNFaceObservation] else { return }
        
        // Process the face observations
        // ...
    }
}
```

We first convert the `UIImage` to a `CGImage` object since the Vision framework works with `CGImage`. Then, we create a `VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest` that will be responsible for detecting faces in the image. The completion handler of this request will provide an array of `VNFaceObservation` objects, which represent the detected faces.

## Step 4: Perform face detection
To perform face detection, call the `perform` method on a `VNImageRequestHandler` instance. Replace the comment inside the `performFaceDetection` function with the following code:

```swift
let imageRequestHandler = VNImageRequestHandler(cgImage: cgImage, options: [:])

do {
    try imageRequestHandler.perform([faceDetectionRequest])
} catch {
    // Handle error
}
```

The `VNImageRequestHandler` is responsible for performing the face detection request on the given image. We pass the `faceDetectionRequest` we created earlier as a parameter to the `perform` method.

## Step 5: Display the results
Now that we have the face observations, we can process them and display the results on the screen. Modify the code inside the completion handler as follows:

```swift
for observation in observations {
    let boundingBox = observation.boundingBox
    let faceBox = CGRect(x: boundingBox.origin.x * image.size.width,
                         y: (1 - boundingBox.origin.y) * image.size.height,
                         width: boundingBox.size.width * image.size.width,
                         height: boundingBox.size.height * image.size.height)
    
    // Draw the face bounding box on the image view
    // ...
}
```

In this snippet, we iterate over each `VNFaceObservation` object and extract the face bounding box coordinates. We then convert these coordinates to match the image view's coordinate system and draw the face bounding box on the image view.

## Step 6: Run face detection in the background
To run the face detection process in the background, we can make use of Grand Central Dispatch (GCD). Update the `performFaceDetection` method as follows:

```swift
func performFaceDetection(on image: UIImage) {
    DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async {
        // ... face detection code
    }
}
```

By dispatching the face detection code to a global background queue, we ensure that the face detection process runs concurrently with the main thread, resulting in a more responsive user interface.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to implement background face detection in Swift using the Vision framework. By performing face detection in the background, we can ensure the smooth operation of our application while processing images in real-time. This technique can be applied to a wide range of applications, from augmented reality to facial recognition systems.
