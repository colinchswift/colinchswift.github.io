QR (Quick Response) codes have become increasingly popular for various applications, such as marketing, authentication, and ticketing. To provide a seamless user experience, it is essential to implement QR code scanning functionality in your iOS app. In this tutorial, we will explore how to perform background QR code scanning in Swift using the AVFoundation framework.

## Prerequisites

Before we proceed, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Xcode 12 or above
- Basic knowledge of Swift and iOS development

## Setting up the Project

1. Open Xcode and create a new project.
2. Choose the **Single View App** template.
3. Enter a product name and other necessary details.
4. Choose your desired options for source control and testing.
5. Select a location to save the project and click **Create**.

## Implementing Background QR Code Scanning

1. Add the following import statement at the top of your ViewController.swift file:
```swift
import AVFoundation
```
2. Next, declare two variables in your view controller:
```swift
var session: AVCaptureSession?
var previewLayer: AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer?
```
3. In your `viewDidLoad()` method, add the following code to initialize the capture session and configure it for video input:
```swift
guard let captureDevice = AVCaptureDevice.default(for: .video) else { return }

do {
    let input = try AVCaptureDeviceInput(device: captureDevice)

    session = AVCaptureSession()
    session?.addInput(input)

    let output = AVCaptureMetadataOutput()
    session?.addOutput(output)

    output.setMetadataObjectsDelegate(self, queue: DispatchQueue.main)
    output.metadataObjectTypes = [AVMetadataObject.ObjectType.qr]

    previewLayer = AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer(session: session!)
    previewLayer?.videoGravity = AVLayerVideoGravity.resizeAspectFill
    previewLayer?.frame = view.layer.bounds
    view.layer.addSublayer(previewLayer!)

    session?.startRunning()

} catch {
    print(error.localizedDescription)
}
```
4. Now, conform to the `AVCaptureMetadataOutputObjectsDelegate` protocol and implement the delegate method `metadataOutput(_:didOutput:from:)`:
```swift
extension ViewController: AVCaptureMetadataOutputObjectsDelegate {
    func metadataOutput(_ output: AVCaptureMetadataOutput, didOutput metadataObjects: [AVMetadataObject], from connection: AVCaptureConnection) {
        if let metadataObj = metadataObjects.first as? AVMetadataMachineReadableCodeObject, let qrCodeString = metadataObj.stringValue {
            print("Detected QR code: \(qrCodeString)")
            // Handle the detected QR code here
        }
    }
}
```
5. Build and run your app. You should now see the live camera feed with QR code scanning enabled.

## Handling Detected QR Codes

In the `didOutput` delegate method, you can access the detected QR code string using the `stringValue` property of `AVMetadataMachineReadableCodeObject`. From here, you can perform any custom logic or trigger specific actions based on the scanned QR code data.

For example, you might want to open a specific URL, decode and process the data, or navigate to a different screen within your app. The possibilities are endless!

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to implement background QR code scanning in Swift using the AVFoundation framework. By following these steps, you can enhance your iOS app by enabling real-time QR code detection and handling.

Remember to consider the user experience and optimize the scanning performance for different lighting conditions to ensure reliable and accurate scanning. Happy coding!
