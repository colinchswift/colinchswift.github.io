## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>
By default, iOS suspends the execution of apps when they are in the background. However, with the appropriate background capabilities enabled and the right handling of Bluetooth tasks, your app can continue running and communicating with Bluetooth devices even when it is not in the foreground.

## Enabling background capabilities<a name="enabling-background-capabilities"></a>
To enable background capabilities for your app, you need to follow these steps:

1. Open your project in Xcode.
2. Go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab.
3. Click on the "+ Capability" button.
4. Select "Background Modes" from the dropdown.
5. Check the "Uses Bluetooth LE accessories" checkbox.

## Background execution modes<a name="background-execution-modes"></a>
There are two background execution modes that are relevant for handling Bluetooth tasks: **Peripheral** and **Central**.

- **Background Peripheral**: This mode allows your app to act as a Bluetooth peripheral and continue advertising data or receiving data from a Bluetooth central device when it is in the background.
- **Background Central**: This mode enables your app to scan for Bluetooth peripherals and connect to them even when it is in the background.

To enable these modes, you need to set the appropriate background execution mode in your app's `Info.plist` file.

## Bluetooth Core APIs<a name="bluetooth-core-apis"></a>
The `CoreBluetooth` framework provides the necessary APIs to interact with Bluetooth devices in iOS. You will need to import this framework into your project to use the Bluetooth-related functionality.

## Handling background peripheral tasks<a name="handling-background-peripheral-tasks"></a>
When your app is in the background and acting as a peripheral, you can continue advertising data to other Bluetooth central devices. To achieve this, you need to adhere to the following guidelines:

- Use the `CBPeripheralManager` class to manage the peripheral tasks.
- Advertise your peripheral data using the `CBAdvertisementData` class.
- Handle the delegate callbacks of `CBPeripheralManagerDelegate` to respond to various events, such as when a central device connects or subscribes to your peripheral.

## Handling background central tasks<a name="handling-background-central-tasks"></a>
To perform background central tasks, such as scanning for and connecting to Bluetooth peripherals, you need to consider the following steps:

- Use the `CBCentralManager` class to manage the central tasks.
- Implement the `CBCentralManagerDelegate` methods to handle central manager events, such as discovering peripherals or connecting to them.
- Set the appropriate scanning options to continue scanning for peripherals even when your app is in the background.
- Use the background execution modes and capabilities mentioned earlier to enable background central tasks.

## Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>
Handling background Bluetooth tasks in Swift is crucial to ensure smooth communication with Bluetooth devices even when the app is not in the foreground. By enabling the right background capabilities and using the Bluetooth Core APIs effectively, you can build robust Bluetooth-enabled applications. Remember to follow the guidelines provided by Apple to ensure your app adheres to the necessary rules and regulations.
