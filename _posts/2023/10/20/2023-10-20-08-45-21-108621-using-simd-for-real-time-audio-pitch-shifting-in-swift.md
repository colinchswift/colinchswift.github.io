Pitch shifting is a common audio processing technique used in various applications such as music production and sound design. It involves altering the pitch of an audio signal without changing its duration. In this blog post, we will explore how to leverage the power of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations in Swift to implement real-time audio pitch shifting.

## Introduction to SIMD

SIMD is a technique that allows for parallel processing of data by applying the same operation across multiple data elements simultaneously. It is particularly useful for computationally intensive tasks like audio processing, image processing, and physics simulations.

Swift provides built-in support for SIMD via the `simd` module. There are different types of SIMD vectors available, such as `SIMD2`, `SIMD3`, `SIMD4`, and `SIMD8`, depending on the number of elements in the vector. Each element in a SIMD vector can be of a different type, such as `Float`, `Double`, or `Int`.

## Implementing Real-time Audio Pitch Shifting

To implement real-time audio pitch shifting, we first need to understand the basic concept behind the pitch shifting algorithm. The algorithm involves dividing the audio signal into small overlapping frames, then applying a frequency shift to each frame, and finally reassembling the frames to produce the shifted audio signal.

We can utilize SIMD to process multiple frames simultaneously, thereby achieving real-time performance. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to perform pitch shifting using SIMD in Swift:

```swift
import AVFoundation
import simd

// Read audio data from a file or capture device
let audioBuffer: AVAudioPCMBuffer = ...

// Settings
let frameSize = 1024
let overlapSize = 256
let pitchShiftAmount: Float = 1.5

// Create buffers for processing
var inputFrames = [SIMD4<Float>]()
var outputFrames = [SIMD4<Float>]()

// Split audio buffer into frames
for i in stride(from: 0, to: audioBuffer.frameLength, by: frameSize - overlapSize) {
    let startIndex = Int(i)
    let endIndex = min(Int(i + frameSize), Int(audioBuffer.frameLength))
    let frame = SIMD4<Float>(UnsafeBufferPointer(start: audioBuffer.floatChannelData![0] + startIndex, count: endIndex - startIndex))
    inputFrames.append(frame)
}

// Process frames
for frame in inputFrames {
    let shiftedFrame = frame * SIMD4<Float>(repeating: pitchShiftAmount)
    outputFrames.append(shiftedFrame)
}

// Combine frames into a single audio buffer
let outputBuffer = AVAudioPCMBuffer(format: audioBuffer.format, frameCapacity: UInt32(outputFrames.count * frameSize))
outputBuffer.frameLength = outputBuffer.frameCapacity

for (index, frame) in outputFrames.enumerated() {
    let startIndex = index * frameSize
    let endIndex = startIndex + frameSize
    let outputFrame = outputBuffer.floatChannelData![0] + startIndex
    outputFrame.initialize(from: frame, count: frameSize)
}

// Play or write the output buffer
```

In this example, we import the `AVFoundation` framework to handle audio input/output. We then define the desired frame size, overlap size, and pitch shift amount. The audio buffer is split into frames, each represented by a SIMD vector. The pitch shift operation is performed on each frame by multiplying it with a SIMD vector containing the pitch shift amount. Finally, the output frames are combined into a single audio buffer and can be played or written to a file.

## Conclusion

Using SIMD for real-time audio pitch shifting in Swift can greatly enhance the performance and efficiency of your audio processing applications. By parallelizing the pitch shift operation using SIMD vectors, you can achieve real-time processing and process multiple audio frames simultaneously.

By leveraging the power of SIMD operations in Swift, you can explore more advanced audio processing techniques and optimize the performance of your applications.
