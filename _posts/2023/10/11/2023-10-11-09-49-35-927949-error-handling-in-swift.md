## Introduction

Error handling is a crucial aspect of writing reliable and robust code. In Swift, error handling allows you to handle and recover from errors that may occur during the execution of your program. This can help you to gracefully handle unexpected situations and prevent your application from crashing.

## Errors in Swift

In Swift, errors are represented by error types that conform to the Error protocol. You can define your own custom error types by creating enumerations, structures, or classes that adopt the Error protocol. Alternatively, you can use the built-in error types provided by Swift and its standard library.

## Handling Errors

To handle errors in Swift, you can use a combination of do-catch statements and try expressions. The `do` keyword is used to enclose the code that can potentially throw an error, while the `catch` keyword is used to catch and handle the error.

Here's an example that demonstrates error handling in Swift:

```swift
func divide(_ dividend: Int, by divisor: Int) throws -> Int {
    guard divisor != 0 else {
        throw DivisionError.divisionByZero
    }
    return dividend / divisor
}

do {
    let result = try divide(10, by: 2)
    print("Result: \(result)")
} catch let error {
    print("An error occurred: \(error)")
}
```

In the code snippet above, a custom error type called `DivisionError` is defined to represent the error condition of division by zero. Inside the `divide` function, the `guard` statement is used to check for the zero divisor and throw the `DivisionError` if encountered. In the `do` block, calling the `divide` function is wrapped in a `try` expression to indicate that it can potentially throw an error. The thrown error is then caught in the `catch` block, where you can handle or display the error message.

## Propagating Errors

In addition to handling errors, you can also propagate errors up the call stack using the `throws` keyword. This allows the caller of a function to catch and handle the error or pass it on to the next level of the call stack.

```swift
func performCalculation() throws {
    let result = try divide(10, by: 0)
    // Handle or use the result
}

do {
    try performCalculation()
} catch let error {
    print("An error occurred: \(error)")
}
```

In the above example, the `performCalculation` function calls the `divide` function which may throw a `DivisionError`. Instead of handling the error inside `performCalculation`, the error is propagated up the call stack using the `throws` keyword. The caller then catches the error and handles it accordingly.

## Conclusion

Error handling in Swift provides a structured and reliable way to handle errors in your application. By using the `do-catch` mechanism and propagating errors, you can handle unexpected situations gracefully and ensure the stability of your code.

For more information on error handling, you can refer to the [official Swift documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ErrorHandling.html).
