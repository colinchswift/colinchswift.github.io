With the introduction of SwiftUI, developers now have the option to build user interfaces for their iOS apps using a declarative and easy-to-use framework. SwiftUI allows for rapid prototyping and simplifies the process of creating complex UIs. However, if you have an existing UIKit-based app and want to incorporate SwiftUI into it, there are a few steps you need to follow. In this article, we will explore how to integrate SwiftUI with existing UIKit code.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of UIKit and SwiftUI, as well as experience with iOS app development.

## Step 1: Creating a SwiftUI view
The first step is to create a new SwiftUI view that will be embedded within your existing UIKit code. You can do this by creating a new Swift file with a SwiftUI view template.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct MySwiftUIView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello SwiftUI!")
            .font(.largeTitle)
            .foregroundColor(.blue)
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple SwiftUI view that displays a text label with a large font size and blue color.

## Step 2: Integrating SwiftUI view into UIKit
Next, we need to modify our existing UIKit code to accommodate the SwiftUI view. One way to do this is by using a `UIHostingController`, which acts as a bridge between the UIKit and SwiftUI frameworks.

```swift
import UIKit
import SwiftUI

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        let mySwiftUIView = MySwiftUIView()
        let hostingController = UIHostingController(rootView: mySwiftUIView)
        addChild(hostingController)
        
        view.addSubview(hostingController.view)
        hostingController.view.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
            hostingController.view.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.topAnchor),
            hostingController.view.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor),
            hostingController.view.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.trailingAnchor),
            hostingController.view.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.bottomAnchor)
        ])
        
        hostingController.didMove(toParent: self)
    }
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of `MySwiftUIView` and create a `UIHostingController` with the SwiftUI view as its `rootView`. We then add the `hostingController`'s view as a subview of our main view controller, using autolayout to ensure it fills the entire screen.

## Step 3: Run the app
Now that we have integrated our SwiftUI view into our existing UIKit code, we can run the app and see the SwiftUI view in action. Build and run the app on a simulator or device, and you should see the SwiftUI view displayed within your existing UIKit app.

## Conclusion
Integrating SwiftUI with existing UIKit code is a great way to leverage the power of SwiftUI while still utilizing your existing codebase. By following the steps outlined in this article, you should now have a basic understanding of how to integrate SwiftUI views into your UIKit-based app. Happy coding!
