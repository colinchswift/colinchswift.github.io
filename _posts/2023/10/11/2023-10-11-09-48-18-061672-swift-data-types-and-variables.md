## Introduction

Swift is a type-safe language, meaning that every variable and expression must have a specific type known at compile time. The type of a value in Swift defines the operations that can be performed with that value. 

## Data Types

### Numeric Types

Swift provides a range of numeric types to represent different kinds of numbers:

- **Int**: Represents signed integers (both positive and negative whole numbers).
- **Double**: Represents floating-point numbers with a larger range and precision than Float.
- **Float**: Represents floating-point numbers with a smaller range and precision than Double.
- **UInt**: Represents unsigned integers (only positive whole numbers).

To declare a variable of a numeric type, you can use the following syntax:

```swift
let myInt: Int = 10
var myDouble: Double = 3.14
var myFloat: Float = 2.71828
let myUInt: UInt = 5
```

### Boolean Type

The Boolean type in Swift represents logical values and can only be `true` or `false`. It is commonly used for conditions and control flow statements.

You can declare a Boolean variable as follows:

```swift
var isOnline: Bool = true
```

### String Type

Strings in Swift are a collection of characters and are used to represent textual data. You can declare a string variable using the following syntax:

```swift
var myString: String = "Hello, World!"
```

### Collection Types

Swift provides several collection types to store multiple values:

- **Array**: An ordered collection of values of the same type.
- **Set**: An unordered collection of distinct values of the same type.
- **Dictionary**: A collection of key-value pairs.

To declare variables of collection types, use the appropriate syntax:

```swift
var myArray: [Int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
var mySet: Set<String> = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
var myDictionary: [String: Any] = ["name": "John", "age": 25, "isStudent": true]
```

## Variables

In Swift, variables are used to store and manage values. To declare a variable, use the `var` keyword followed by the variable name, a colon, and the type annotation. Here's an example:

```swift
var myVariable: Int = 42
```

Once a variable is declared, its value can be changed by assigning a new value using the assignment operator (`=`):

```swift
myVariable = 50
```

## Conclusion

Understanding data types and variables is fundamental when programming in Swift. By utilizing the appropriate data types and declaring variables correctly, you ensure type safety and enable efficient manipulation of data. So go ahead, experiment with different data types and variables in Swift and unleash the power of this dynamic language!
