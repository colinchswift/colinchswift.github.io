In a web application, it's often necessary to send notifications to users and send emails for various purposes such as user account verification, password reset, or promotional campaigns. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement notifications and email sending in a Swift Vapor application.

## Setting up the Project

Before we begin, make sure you have a working Swift Vapor project set up. You can refer to the official Vapor documentation for detailed instructions on how to create a new project or follow an existing one.

## Implementing Notifications

Notifications in Vapor are a great way to send real-time updates or alerts to users. To implement notifications, follow these steps:

1. Define a `Notification` struct with properties such as `title`, `message`, and any other relevant information.

    ```swift
    struct Notification: Content {
        var title: String
        var message: String
        // Additional properties
    }
    ```

2. Create a route that accepts a `Notification` object and sends it to the desired user(s). You can use methods like `broadcast` or `send` to send the notification to specific users or all connected users.

    ```swift
    import Vapor

    // Create a route
    router.post("send-notification") { req -> EventLoopFuture<HTTPStatus> in
        let notification = try req.content.decode(Notification.self)
        // Send the notification to users
        try req.application.webSockets.send(notification, to: "some-user-id")
        return req.eventLoop.makeSucceededFuture(.ok)
    }
    ```

3. Test the notification route by sending a POST request with the `Notification` object to the `/send-notification` endpoint. You can use tools like cURL or Postman for this purpose.

With these steps, you can implement notifications in your Vapor application.

## Sending Emails

To send emails in Vapor, we can leverage various email service providers like SendGrid or Mailgun. In this example, we will use SendGrid. Follow these steps to send emails:

1. Add the necessary dependencies to your project by adding the following to your `Package.swift` file:

    ```swift
    dependencies: [
        // Other dependencies
        .package(url: "https://github.com/vapor-community/sendgrid.git", from: "4.0.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            // Target details
            dependencies: [
                // Other dependencies
                .product(name: "SendGrid", package: "sendgrid")
            ]
        )
    ]
    ```

2. Create a route for sending emails:

    ```swift
    import Vapor
    import SendGrid

    router.post("send-email") { req -> EventLoopFuture<HTTPStatus> in
        let email = try req.content.decode(Email.self)
        let sendGridClient = try req.make(SendGridClient.self)
        
        let personalization = Personalization(
            to: [.init(email: email.recipientEmail)],
            bcc: [.init(email: "bcc@example.com")],
            subject: email.subject
        )
        let content = Content.email(from: email.senderEmail, subject: email.subject, plainText: email.message)
        let sendGridEmail = SendGridEmail(personalizations: [personalization], content: content)
        
        return sendGridClient.send(sendGridEmail, on: req.eventLoop)
            .map { _ in
                return .ok
            }
    }
    ```

3. Create an `Email` struct with properties such as `senderEmail`, `recipientEmail`, `subject`, and `message`. This struct will be used to decode the email content from the request body.

    ```swift
    struct Email: Content {
        var senderEmail: String
        var recipientEmail: String
        var subject: String
        var message: String
    }
    ```

4. Test the email route by sending a POST request with the `Email` object to the `/send-email` endpoint.

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented email sending in your Swift Vapor application using SendGrid.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement notifications and email sending in a Swift Vapor application. Notifications keep users updated with real-time alerts, while email sending allows us to communicate important information with users via email. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily incorporate these features into your Vapor application.
