## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement file storage and CDN integration in a Swift Vapor web application. File storage is an essential component of many web applications, allowing users to upload and store files such as images, videos, and documents. Additionally, using a CDN (Content Delivery Network) can help in efficiently delivering these files to users worldwide.

We will leverage the power of the Vapor web framework along with the popular Vapor package called `S3Kit` to integrate with AWS S3 for file storage, and `Vapor Cloudinary` for CDN integration using the Cloudinary service.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following:

- Xcode installed on your machine
- Swift Vapor set up in your project

## Setting up AWS S3 for file storage

To get started with AWS S3 for file storage, you will need to set up an AWS account and configure your access keys. Once you have your access keys, follow these steps:

1. Install the `S3Kit` package by adding the following line to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/vapor-community/s3-kit.git", from: "4.1.0")
```

2. Update your target dependencies with `S3Kit`:

```swift
.target(name: "App", dependencies: [
   // ...
   .product(name: "S3Kit", package: "s3-kit"),
   // ...
])
```

3. Import the necessary modules in your Vapor application:

```swift
import S3Kit
```

4. Configure the `S3Kit` with your AWS access key and secret key in your `configure.swift` file:

```swift
let s3Config = S3Manager.Configuration(accessKey: "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY", secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY", region: .useast1)
services.register(s3Config)
```

5. With the setup complete, you can now use the `S3Manager` to interact with AWS S3 for storing files. Refer to the `S3Kit` documentation for detailed usage examples.

## Integrating Cloudinary for CDN integration

Next, let's integrate Cloudinary for CDN integration, which will help deliver the stored files efficiently to users worldwide. Follow these steps:

1. Install the `Vapor Cloudinary` package by adding the Cloudinary dependency to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/vapor-community/cloudinary-kit.git", from: "1.1.0")
```

2. Add the `CloudinaryProvider` to your Vapor application's `configure.swift` file:

```swift
import VaporCloudinary

// ...

try services.register(CloudinaryProvider())
```

3. Configure the Cloudinary provider with your Cloudinary credentials. You can obtain the credentials from the Cloudinary dashboard:

```swift
let cloudinaryConfig = Cloudinary.Configuration(
    cloudName: "YOUR_CLOUD_NAME",
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    apiSecret: "YOUR_API_SECRET"
)
services.register(cloudinaryConfig)
```

4. With the setup complete, you can now use the `CloudinaryImage` and `CloudinaryURL` types to work with Cloudinary for CDN integration.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to implement file storage and CDN integration in a Swift Vapor web application. We used the `S3Kit` package to integrate with AWS S3 for file storage and the `Vapor Cloudinary` package for CDN integration using the Cloudinary service. With these integrations, you can now efficiently upload, store, and deliver files to users in your Vapor application.
