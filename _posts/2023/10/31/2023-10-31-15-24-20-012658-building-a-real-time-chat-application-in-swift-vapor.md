Chat applications have become an integral part of our daily lives. The ability to communicate in real-time is a valuable feature in many applications. In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a real-time chat application using Swift Vapor, a powerful web framework for building APIs and web applications.

## Introduction

Swift Vapor is a server-side Swift framework that allows developers to build robust web applications. It provides a powerful routing system, middleware support, and various tools for handling HTTP requests and responses. With Vapor's WebSocket support, we can easily implement real-time communication in our application.

## Setting Up the Project

To get started, make sure you have Swift and Vapor installed on your system. If you haven't installed them yet, you can follow the official Vapor documentation for installation instructions.

Once you have Vapor installed, create a new Vapor project by running the following commands in your terminal:

```swift
vapor new ChatApp
cd ChatApp
```

This will create a new Vapor project named "ChatApp" and navigate to its directory.

## Creating the WebSocket Endpoint

In the Vapor project directory, open the `Sources/App/configure.swift` file. This file is where we configure our application.

Add the following code inside the `configure` function to enable WebSocket support:

```swift
import Vapor

public func configure(_ app: Application) throws {
    // Other configuration code...
    
    app.webSocket("chat", onUpgrade: handleWebSocket)
    
    // Other configuration code...
}

public func handleWebSocket(_ req: Request, socket: WebSocket) {
    // WebSocket logic goes here
}
```

The `app.webSocket()` function sets up a WebSocket route at `/chat` and calls the `handleWebSocket()` function whenever a WebSocket connection is established.

## Handling WebSocket Events

Inside the `handleWebSocket` function, we can handle different WebSocket events such as connection opening, message received, or connection closing.

To handle the WebSocket connection opening event, add the following code inside the `handleWebSocket()` function:

```swift
socket.on(.open) { _ in
    // Connection opened
    // Perform any necessary setup tasks
}
```

To handle incoming messages, add the following code:

```swift
socket.on(.text) { _, message in
    // Message received
    // Process the message and send appropriate response
}
```

And to handle the connection closing event, add the following code:

```swift
socket.on(.close) { _, _ in
    // Connection closed
    // Perform any cleanup tasks
}
```

## Implementing the Chat Logic

Now that we have the WebSocket endpoint set up, let's implement the chat logic.

Inside the `handleWebSocket()` function, we can keep track of connected clients using a `WebSocketClientManager` object. Add the following code after the opening event handler:

```swift
let client = WebSocketClient(socket: socket, request: req)
WebSocketClientManager.shared.addClient(client)
```

Next, we need to implement the logic for processing incoming messages and sending them to all connected clients.

```swift
socket.on(.text) { _, message in
    guard let clients = WebSocketClientManager.shared.clients else {
        return
    }
    
    for client in clients {
        client.socket.send(message)
    }
}
```

The code above broadcasts the received message to all connected clients.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to build a real-time chat application using Swift Vapor. We explored setting up a WebSocket endpoint, handling WebSocket events, and implementing the chat logic. With Vapor's powerful WebSocket support, building real-time applications becomes a breeze.
