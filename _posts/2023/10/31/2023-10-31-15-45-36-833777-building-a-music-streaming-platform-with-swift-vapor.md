## Introduction

A music streaming platform allows users to listen to their favorite songs on-demand. Our goal is to build a backend server using Swift and Vapor that can handle user registrations, managing music catalogs, and streaming songs to clients.

## Setting Up the Project

To begin, we need to set up a new Vapor project. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```shell
vapor new MusicStreamingPlatform
```

This will bootstrap a new Vapor project called `MusicStreamingPlatform`. Navigate to the project directory using `cd MusicStreamingPlatform`.

## Creating Models

In our music streaming platform, we need models to represent users, songs, and playlists. Create a new folder called `Models` inside your project's `Sources` directory. This folder will contain our model definitions.

Let's start by creating a `User` model. Inside the `Models` folder, create a new file called `User.swift` and add the following code:

```swift
import Vapor
import Fluent

final class User: Model, Content {
    static let schema = "users"

    @ID(key: .id)
    var id: UUID?

    @Field(key: "name")
    var name: String

    // Add other properties like email, password, etc.

    init() {}

    init(id: UUID? = nil, name: String) {
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
    }
}
```

Similarly, create models for `Song` and `Playlist` with their respective properties.

## Implementing Controllers

Next, we need to implement controllers to handle CRUD operations on our models. Create a new folder called `Controllers` inside the project's `Sources` directory and create a Swift file for each model.

In the `UserController.swift` file, add the following code:

```swift
import Vapor

struct UserController: RouteCollection {
    func boot(routes: RoutesBuilder) throws {
        let usersRoute = routes.grouped("api", "users")
        usersRoute.get(use: getAllHandler)
        usersRoute.post(use: createHandler)
        usersRoute.get(":userID", use: getHandler)
        usersRoute.delete(":userID", use: deleteHandler)
    }

    func getAllHandler(req: Request) throws -> EventLoopFuture<[User]> {
        return User.query(on: req.db).all()
    }

    // Implement other handler functions like createHandler, getHandler, deleteHandler
}
```

Similarly, create controllers for `Song` and `Playlist` with their respective handler functions.

## Streaming Music

To enable music streaming, we need to implement a way to serve audio files to clients. Vapor provides a middleware called `FileMiddleware` that we can use for this purpose.

Open the `configure.swift` file in your project's `Sources/App` directory and add the following code inside the `public func configure(_ app: Application) throws` function:

```swift
let fileMiddleware = FileMiddleware(publicDirectory: app.directory.publicDirectory)
app.middleware.use(fileMiddleware)
```

This will enable serving static files from the `Public` directory of our project.

To expose the music streaming functionality, we can create a route handler that allows clients to download audio files. For example:

```swift
app.get("api", "songs", ":songID", "stream") { req -> FileResponse in
    let songID = req.parameters.get("songID")!
    let songFilePath = app.directory.publicDirectory + "songs/\(songID).mp3"
    return req.fileio.streamFile(at: songFilePath)
}
```

This handler assumes that we have an `id` property for each song and the audio files are stored in the `Public/songs` directory.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have learned how to build a music streaming platform using Swift and Vapor. We covered the basics of setting up a project, creating models, implementing controllers, and enabling music streaming functionality. Swift and Vapor provide a powerful combination for building robust and scalable backend systems.
