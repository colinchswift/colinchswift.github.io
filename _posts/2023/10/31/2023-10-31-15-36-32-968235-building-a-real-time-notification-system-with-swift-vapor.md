In today's fast-paced world, real-time communication has become crucial for many applications. Whether it's receiving instant updates or sending push notifications, users expect a seamless and responsive experience. In this blog post, we will explore how to build a real-time notification system using Swift Vapor, a popular web framework for Swift.

## Introduction

Swift Vapor provides excellent support for building web applications and APIs, and it also includes built-in support for WebSocket communication. WebSocket is a protocol that allows for full-duplex, real-time communication between the client and the server, enabling the server to push data to the client without the need for constant polling.

## Setting up Vapor

To get started, make sure you have Vapor installed on your machine. If not, install it by following the official documentation. Once installed, create a new Vapor project using the `vapor new` command, and navigate to the project directory.

## Implementing WebSocket

In Vapor, implementing WebSocket communication is straightforward. Start by creating a new WebSocket route handler by adding the following code to your `routes.swift` file:

```swift
import Vapor

func socketHandler(_ req: Request, _ ws: WebSocket) {
    // Handle WebSocket connection
}

routes.webSocket("notifications", use: socketHandler)
```

The `socketHandler` function handles the WebSocket connection and receives a `WebSocket` object that represents the connection. Here, you can perform any necessary setup or handle incoming messages.

To establish a WebSocket connection from the client-side, you can use JavaScript or any library that supports WebSocket communication. For example, using JavaScript:

```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/notifications');

socket.onopen = function(event) {
    console.log('WebSocket connection established');
};

socket.onmessage = function(event) {
    // Handle incoming messages
};

socket.onclose = function(event) {
    console.log('WebSocket connection closed');
};
```

## Sending Notifications

Once the WebSocket connection is established, you can start sending notifications from the server to the connected clients. In the `socketHandler` function, you can use `ws.send()` to send messages to the client.

```swift
func socketHandler(_ req: Request, _ ws: WebSocket) {
    // Handle WebSocket connection
    
    ws.send("Welcome to the real-time notification system!")
    
    // Send notifications
    DispatchQueue.global().async {
        while ws.state == .open {
            let notification = "New notification"
            ws.send(notification)
            sleep(1) // Add delay between notifications
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we send a welcome message when the client connects, and then continuously send notifications with a delay of 1 second. You can modify this logic to suit your application's requirements.

## Conclusion

With Swift Vapor and WebSocket, building a real-time notification system becomes a breeze. By leveraging the power of WebSocket, you can provide your users with instant updates and enhance the overall user experience. Remember to handle error cases and properly manage WebSocket connections in a production-ready system.

So, why not add real-time notifications to your Swift Vapor application and take user experience to the next level?
