In this blog post, we will discuss how to implement search functionality in Swift Vapor. Search is a common feature in many web applications, allowing users to quickly find specific information. We will be using Vapor, a popular web framework, to build our search functionality.

## Setting Up Vapor Project

First, make sure you have Vapor installed on your machine. You can install it using Homebrew or by downloading the Vapor toolbox from the official Vapor website.

Once Vapor is installed, create a new Vapor project by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
vapor new MySearchApp --template=api
```

This will create a new Vapor project with the basic API template.

## Creating a Search Route

Next, we need to create a route that will handle the search functionality. Open the `routes.swift` file in the `Sources/App` directory. Replace the existing code with the following:

```swift
import Vapor

func routes(_ app: Application) throws {
    app.get("search", ":query", use: searchHandler)
}

func searchHandler(_ req: Request) throws -> String {
    guard let query = req.parameters.get("query") else {
        throw Abort(.badRequest, reason: "Invalid search query")
    }

    // Implement search logic here
    
    return "Search results for '\(query)': ..."
}
```

In the code above, we define a route `/search/{query}` that will be handled by the `searchHandler` function. The search query is extracted from the route parameters.

## Implementing Search Logic

Now, let's implement the search logic in the `searchHandler` function. You can use any search algorithm or library depending on your specific requirements. For simplicity, we'll use a basic string matching algorithm.

```swift
func searchHandler(_ req: Request) throws -> String {
    guard let query = req.parameters.get("query") else {
        throw Abort(.badRequest, reason: "Invalid search query")
    }

    let data = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "pineapple"]

    let results = data.filter { $0.contains(query) }

    return "Search results for '\(query)': \(results.joined(separator: ", "))"
}
```

In this example, we have a hardcoded array of strings representing our data. We filter the array based on the query using the `contains` method and return the matching results.

## Testing the Search Functionality

To test our search functionality, start your Vapor server by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
vapor run
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080/search/apple` in your web browser, and you should see the search results for "apple". You can replace "apple" with any other search query to test different scenarios.

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented search functionality in Swift Vapor.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to implement search functionality in Swift Vapor. We created a search route, implemented the search logic, and tested the functionality. This is just a basic example, and you can enhance it further by integrating more advanced search algorithms or connecting to a database. Vapor provides a solid foundation for building robust web applications, and search functionality is just one of the many features you can implement using Vapor.
