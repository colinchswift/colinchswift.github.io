Handling file uploads is a common requirement in many web applications. In this blog post, we will explore how to handle file uploads in a Swift Vapor application. We will cover how to receive and save uploaded files, as well as how to validate and process them.

## Setting up a Vapor project

First, let's set up a basic Vapor project. If you haven't already installed Vapor, you can do so by following the instructions in the official Vapor documentation.

Create a new Vapor project by running the following command in your terminal:

```swift
vapor new FileUploadDemo
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```swift
cd FileUploadDemo
```

Now we can start implementing file upload functionality in our Vapor application.

## Receiving file uploads

To receive file uploads in Vapor, we need to use a `POST` route and a multipart form data parser. Here's an example of how to set up a route to handle file uploads:

```swift
import Vapor

func configure(_ app: Application) throws {
    app.post("upload") { req -> EventLoopFuture<String> in
        let file = try req.content.decode(File.self)
        // process the uploaded file
        return req.eventLoop.future("File uploaded successfully!")
    }
}
```

In the above example, we define a `POST` route at the `/upload` path. Inside the route closure, we use the `req.content.decode(_: File.self)` method to decode the incoming request content as a `File` model. We'll define the `File` model in the next section.

## Saving uploaded files

To save the uploaded file, we can use the `FileManager` class provided by the Foundation framework. We'll create a `File` model with a `name` and `data` property to store the uploaded file information.

```swift
import Vapor

struct File: Content {
    var name: String
    var data: Data
}

func configure(_ app: Application) throws {
    // ...
    app.post("upload") { req -> EventLoopFuture<String> in
        let file = try req.content.decode(File.self)
        try saveFile(file: file)
        return req.eventLoop.future("File uploaded successfully!")
    }
}

func saveFile(file: File) throws {
    let fileURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "path/to/save/\(file.name)")
    try file.data.write(to: fileURL)
}
```

In the above example, we added a `saveFile(file: File)` helper function to handle saving the uploaded file. We generate a `fileURL` based on the desired save path and the `name` property of the uploaded file. Then, we write the `data` of the file to the `fileURL`.

## Validating uploaded files

Before saving the uploaded file, we might want to perform some validation checks to ensure the file meets our requirements. For example, we can validate the file size or file type. Here's an example of how to add validation checks:

```swift
import Vapor

func configure(_ app: Application) throws {
    // ...
    app.post("upload") { req -> EventLoopFuture<String> in
        let file = try req.content.decode(File.self)
        try validateFile(file: file)
        try saveFile(file: file)
        return req.eventLoop.future("File uploaded successfully!")
    }
}

func validateFile(file: File) throws {
    let maxSize: Int = 10 * 1024 * 1024 // 10 MB
    if file.data.count > maxSize {
        throw Abort(.badRequest, reason: "File size exceeds the maximum limit.")
    }
    // Add more validation checks as per your requirements
}
```

In the above example, we added a `validateFile(file: File)` helper function to validate the uploaded file. We set a maximum size limit, and if the file size exceeds the limit, we throw an `Abort` error with a custom reason.

## Processing uploaded files

Once the file is successfully saved, we can perform any further processing as needed. This could include generating thumbnails, extracting metadata, or storing file details in a database. Here's an example of how to add a processing step:

```swift
import Vapor

func configure(_ app: Application) throws {
    // ...
    app.post("upload") { req -> EventLoopFuture<String> in
        let file = try req.content.decode(File.self)
        try validateFile(file: file)
        try saveFile(file: file)
        processFile(file: file)
        return req.eventLoop.future("File uploaded successfully!")
    }
}

func processFile(file: File) {
    // Further processing logic goes here
    // e.g. Generate thumbnail, extract metadata, etc.
    print("File processing completed.")
}
```

In the above example, we added a `processFile(file: File)` helper function to perform any further processing of the uploaded file.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to handle file uploads in a Swift Vapor application. We covered receiving and saving uploaded files, as well as validating and processing them. Understanding the basics of file uploads and handling in Vapor will enable you to build more powerful and flexible web applications. Happy coding!
