## Introduction to Swift Vapor

Swift Vapor is a server-side web framework written in Swift that allows you to create powerful and scalable web applications. It provides a clean and expressive syntax that makes it easy to build APIs, web services, and more.

## Setting up the Project

To get started, make sure you have Swift and Vapor installed on your machine. You can install Vapor using Homebrew by running the following command:

```shell
brew install vapor
```

Once Vapor is installed, you can create a new project by running the following command:

```shell
vapor new FitnessTracker
```

This will create a new Vapor project called "FitnessTracker" in the current directory.

## Creating the Models

In our fitness tracking app, we will need two models: `User` and `Workout`. The `User` model will represent the users of our app, while the `Workout` model will store the details of each workout.

```swift
import Vapor
import Fluent

final class User: Model, Content {
    static let schema = "users"
    
    @ID(key: .id)
    var id: UUID?
    
    // User properties
    
    init() {}
}

final class Workout: Model, Content {
    static let schema = "workouts"
    
    @ID(key: .id)
    var id: UUID?
    
    // Workout properties
    
    init() {}
}
```

## Implementing the Routes

Next, let's implement the routes for our app. In the `routes.swift` file, add the following code:

```swift
import Vapor

func routes(_ app: Application) throws {
    // User routes
    
    // Workout routes
}
```

We will need routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting both users and workouts. You can add these routes using Vapor's routing syntax.

## Building the User Interface

Now that we have our models and routes set up, we can start building the user interface for our app. We can use Vapor's templating engine to create dynamic HTML templates.

First, let's create a new folder called `Views` in the root directory of our project. Inside this folder, create a new file called `index.leaf`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Fitness Tracker</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to Fitness Tracker</h1>
    
    <!-- User interface elements -->
    
    <!-- Workout interface elements -->
</body>
</html>
```

In this file, we can add the necessary HTML elements to display the user interface of our app.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to build a fitness tracking and workout app using Swift Vapor. We covered the basics of setting up the project, creating models, implementing routes, and building the user interface. With Vapor's powerful features and flexible architecture, you can extend this app further and add more functionality based on your requirements.
