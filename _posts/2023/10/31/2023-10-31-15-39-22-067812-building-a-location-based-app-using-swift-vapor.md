In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a location-based app using Swift Vapor, a popular web framework for building server-side Swift applications. We will leverage the power of Vapor's routing system and integrate with a location service to enable fetching and storing location data.

## 1. Setting up a Vapor project <a name="setup"></a>

To get started, we need to set up a new Vapor project. Make sure you have Vapor installed and run the following commands:

```bash
$ vapor new LocationApp
$ cd LocationApp
```

This will create a new Vapor project named "LocationApp" and navigate to its directory. 

## 2. Integrating with a Location Service <a name="integration"></a>

To fetch location data, we will integrate our app with a location service provider. For this example, let's use the Google Maps Geocoding API. First, we need to obtain an API key from the Google Cloud Console.

Once you have the API key, open the `Package.swift` file in your Vapor project and add the following dependency:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/vapor-community/google-maps.git", from: "2.0.0")
```

Next, navigate to the `configure.swift` file and import the required modules:

```swift
import GoogleMaps
import CoreLocation
```

In the `configure(_:environment:_:)` method, add the following code to configure the GoogleMaps provider with your API key:

```swift
let googleMapsAPIKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"
services.register(GoogleMapsGeocodingProvider(apiKey: googleMapsAPIKey))
```

## 3. Retrieving and Storing Location Data <a name="data"></a>

Now that we have integrated our app with the Google Maps Geocoding API, let's define a route to handle location requests. In the `routes.swift` file, add the following code:

```swift
import GoogleMaps

func routes(_ app: Application) throws {
    app.get("location", ":address") { req -> EventLoopFuture<GeocodingResponse> in
        let geocoding = req.application.make(Geocoding.self)
        let address = req.parameters.get("address")
        return try geocoding.geocode(address: address, region: nil, components: nil, bounds: nil, language: nil, client: req).map { response in
            return response
        }
    }
}
```

This route handler will take an address as a parameter and return the geocoded location data using the Google Maps Geocoding API.

To test the location endpoint, start the Vapor app by running:

```bash
$ vapor run
```

Then open your browser or an API testing tool and make a GET request to `http://localhost:8080/location/{address}` where `{address}` is the address you want to geocode.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

In this tutorial, we explored how to build a location-based app using Swift Vapor. We integrated our app with the Google Maps Geocoding API and implemented a route to fetch and store location data. This is just a basic example, but with Vapor's powerful routing system and the ability to integrate with various services, you can build advanced location-based applications.
