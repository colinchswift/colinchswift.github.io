In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement peer-to-peer messaging and video calling using Swift Vapor framework. Swift Vapor is a powerful web framework for Swift that allows you to easily build web applications and APIs. By leveraging the capabilities of Vapor, we can create a real-time communication system for messaging and video calling.

## Introduction
Peer-to-peer messaging enables users to communicate directly with each other without the need for a centralized server. This approach can provide faster and more efficient communication between devices. Video calling extends this functionality by allowing users to have real-time video conversations.

## Setting up the project
To get started, let's create a new Vapor project by following these steps:

1. Install Vapor by running the command `brew tap vapor/tap` followed by `brew install vapor`.
2. Create a new Vapor project by running `vapor new PeerToPeerMessaging`.
3. Navigate to the project directory using `cd PeerToPeerMessaging`.

## Implementing peer-to-peer messaging
1. First, let's set up the necessary dependencies by adding the following to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/vapor/websocket-kit.git", from: "2.0.0"),
.package(url: "https://github.com/vapor/leaf.git", from: "4.0.0")
```

2. Update your `configure.swift` file to include the following code:

```swift
import WebSocketKit

app.webSocket("chat") { req, ws in
    ws.onText { ws, text in
        // Handle received messages
    }

    ws.onClose.whenSuccess {
        // Handle connection closed
    }
}
```

3. In your `routes.swift` file, add the following WebSocket route:

```swift
public func routes(_ router: Router) throws {
    router.get("chat", use: chatHandler)
}

func chatHandler(_ req: Request) throws -> Future<View> {
    return try req.view().render("chat")
}
```

4. Create a new `chat.leaf` file in your `Resources/Views` directory with the following content:

```html
<html>
<head>
    <script>
        // Implement client-side WebSocket code here
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="chat-container"></div>
    <input id="chat-input" type="text">
    <button id="send-button">Send</button>
</body>
</html>
```

5. Implement the JavaScript code to handle the WebSocket connection and handling received messages on the client-side.

## Implementing video calling
To implement video calling, we can leverage the WebRTC technology. WebRTC allows real-time communication between browsers and provides support for video and audio streaming.

1. Include the necessary WebRTC JavaScript libraries in your `chat.leaf` file:

```html
<script src="https://webrtc.github.io/adapter/adapter-latest.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/webrtc/1.0.0/webrtc.js"></script>
```

2. Add video call buttons to your `chat.leaf` file:

```html
<button id="start-call-button">Start Call</button>
<button id="end-call-button">End Call</button>
```

3. Implement the JavaScript code for handling video calling functionality, including starting and ending calls, capturing and sending video, and displaying received video.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to implement peer-to-peer messaging and video calling using Swift Vapor. By combining the power of Vapor with WebRTC, we can provide real-time communication features in our applications. This allows us to build more interactive and engaging user experiences.
