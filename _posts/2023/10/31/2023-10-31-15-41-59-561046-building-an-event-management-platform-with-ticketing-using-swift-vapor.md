In this tutorial, we will walk you through building an event management platform with ticketing capabilities using Swift Vapor, a popular server-side Swift framework. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a basic understanding of how to create a web application using Vapor and implement ticketing functionality.

## Setting up a new Vapor project
To begin, make sure you have Swift and Vapor installed on your system. You can install Vapor by following the official documentation from [vapor.codes](https://vapor.codes/).

Once you have Vapor installed, create a new project by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
vapor new EventManagementApp
```

This will create a new Vapor project named "EventManagementApp" in your current directory.

## Creating the Event model
Next, let's create the model for the event. In Vapor, models are typically defined as structs conforming to the `Model` protocol. Create a new file called `Event.swift` in the `Sources/App/Models/` directory and add the following code:

```swift
import Vapor
import Fluent

final class Event: Model, Content {
    static let schema = "events"
    
    @ID(key: .id)
    var id: UUID?
    
    @Field(key: "name")
    var name: String
    
    // Add other properties for the event
    
    init() { }
    
    init(id: UUID? = nil, name: String) {
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
    }
}
```

This defines the `Event` model with an `id` and `name` property. You can add additional properties as per your requirement. Make sure to update the database schema name based on your needs.

## Implementing ticket creation and management
Now that we have the `Event` model, let's implement the functionality to create and manage tickets for the events.

### Creating the Ticket model
Similar to the `Event` model, create a new file called `Ticket.swift` in the `Sources/App/Models/` directory and add the following code:

```swift
import Vapor
import Fluent

final class Ticket: Model, Content {
    static let schema = "tickets"
    
    @ID(key: .id)
    var id: UUID?
    
    @Parent(key: "event_id")
    var event: Event
    
    // Add other properties for the ticket
    
    init() { }
    
    init(id: UUID? = nil, eventID: UUID) {
        self.id = id
        self.$event.id = eventID
    }
}
```

This defines the `Ticket` model with an `id` property and a relationship to the `Event` model using the `event_id`. Update the model to include any other properties you want for the ticket.

### Creating and updating tickets
With the `Ticket` model in place, we can now create and update tickets for an event. In your preferred controller, add the following code:

```swift
import Vapor

struct TicketController: RouteCollection {
    // Add routes and handlers for ticket creation and management
}
```

Inside the `TicketController`, you can define routes and handlers to handle ticket creation, retrieval, update, and deletion. These routes can be accessed via appropriate endpoints in your application.

## Displaying event details and available tickets
To display event details and available tickets, create a new route and handler in your preferred controller. In the handler, query the events and associated tickets from the database, and return the appropriate response.

## Handling ticket purchases
Lastly, to handle ticket purchases, create a new route and handler in your controller. These routes will receive the necessary data from the client and process the ticket purchase. You can update the ticket status and perform any necessary business logic before returning the response.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have built a simple event management platform with ticketing capabilities using Swift Vapor. You learned how to create models, implement CRUD operations, and handle ticket purchases. There is still much more you can add to make your application feature-rich and scalable. Feel free to explore more of Vapor's capabilities and integrate other tools as needed. Happy coding!
