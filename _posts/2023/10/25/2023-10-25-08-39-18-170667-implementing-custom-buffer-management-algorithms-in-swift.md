## Introduction

Buffer management refers to the allocation and deallocation of memory buffers for various operations. In certain scenarios, the default buffer management algorithms provided by the system may not be efficient for specific use cases. In such cases, implementing custom buffer management algorithms can lead to better memory utilization and performance.

Buffer management algorithms fall under two broad categories: retention-based and replacement-based algorithms. Retention-based algorithms manage buffers based on specific retention policies, while replacement-based algorithms decide which buffer to replace based on certain criteria.

In this blog post, we will focus on two popular replacement-based buffer management algorithms: Least Recently Used (LRU) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO).

## Buffer Management Algorithms

### Least Recently Used (LRU)

The LRU algorithm replaces the least recently used buffer when the buffer pool is full. It uses a timestamp or a counter to keep track of the last access time of each buffer. When a new buffer is needed and the buffer pool is full, the buffer with the oldest timestamp or lowest counter value is replaced.

### First-In-First-Out (FIFO)

The FIFO algorithm replaces the buffer that has been in the buffer pool the longest when a new buffer is needed. It maintains a queue of buffers and follows a first-in-first-out strategy for buffer replacement.

## Implementation in Swift

### LRU Buffer Manager

To implement an LRU buffer manager in Swift, you can use a combination of a dictionary and a linked list. The dictionary stores the buffers with their corresponding keys, while the linked list tracks the order of buffer usage.

Here is an example implementation of an LRU buffer manager in Swift:

```swift
class LRUBufferManager<Key: Hashable, Value> {
    private var cache: [Key: Node<Key, Value>] = [:]
    private var head: Node<Key, Value>? = nil
    private var tail: Node<Key, Value>? = nil
    private let capacity: Int

    init(capacity: Int) {
        self.capacity = capacity
    }

    func get(_ key: Key) -> Value? {
        guard let node = cache[key] else { return nil }

        promoteNodeToHead(node)
        return node.value
    }

    func put(key: Key, value: Value) {
        if let node = cache[key] {
            node.value = value
            promoteNodeToHead(node)
        } else {
            let newNode = Node(key: key, value: value)
            cache[newNode.key] = newNode

            if let headNode = head {
                newNode.next = headNode
                headNode.previous = newNode
            } else {
                tail = newNode
            }

            head = newNode

            if cache.count > capacity {
                if let tailNode = tail {
                    cache[tailNode.key] = nil
                    removeNode(tailNode)
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private func promoteNodeToHead(_ node: Node<Key, Value>) {
        guard node !== head else { return }

        let previousNode = node.previous
        let nextNode = node.next

        previousNode?.next = nextNode

        if nextNode == nil {
            tail = previousNode
        } else {
            nextNode?.previous = previousNode
        }

        node.previous = nil
        node.next = head
        head?.previous = node
        head = node
    }

    private func removeNode(_ node: Node<Key, Value>) {
        let previousNode = node.previous
        let nextNode = node.next

        previousNode?.next = nextNode

        if previousNode == nil {
            head = nextNode
        } else {
            previousNode?.next = nextNode
        }

        nextNode?.previous = previousNode
    }

    private class Node<Key, Value> {
        let key: Key
        var value: Value
        var previous: Node<Key, Value>?
        var next: Node<Key, Value>?

        init(key: Key, value: Value) {
            self.key = key
            self.value = value
        }
    }
}
```

### FIFO Buffer Manager

To implement a FIFO buffer manager in Swift, you can use a queue data structure. The queue maintains the order of buffer insertion and removal.

Here is an example implementation of a FIFO buffer manager in Swift:

```swift
class FIFOBufferManager<Key: Hashable, Value> {
    private var cache: [Key: Value] = [:]
    private var queue: [Key] = []
    private let capacity: Int

    init(capacity: Int) {
        self.capacity = capacity
    }

    func get(_ key: Key) -> Value? {
        return cache[key]
    }

    func put(key: Key, value: Value) {
        if cache[key] == nil {
            if cache.count >= capacity, let removedKey = queue.first {
                cache[removedKey] = nil
                queue.removeFirst()
            }
            queue.append(key)
        }
        cache[key] = value
    }
}
```
