## Introduction

Managed buffers in Swift provide a convenient way to manipulate and work with large blocks of memory. For compression and decompression tasks, using managed buffers can greatly improve performance and memory usage.

## Compression

### Deflate Compression

The Deflate compression algorithm is a widely used algorithm that provides a good balance between compression speed and ratio. To perform deflate compression on a Swift managed buffer, you can use the `Compression` framework provided by Apple. Here's an example:

```swift
import Compression

func deflateCompress(data: Data) throws -> Data {
    var compressedData = Data(count: data.count)
    try compressedData.withUnsafeMutableBytes { compressedBytes in
        try data.withUnsafeBytes { dataBytes in
            let compressedSize = compression_encode_buffer(compressedBytes.baseAddress!,
                                                          compressedBytes.count,
                                                          dataBytes.baseAddress!,
                                                          dataBytes.count,
                                                          nil,
                                                          COMPRESSION_ZLIB)
            if compressedSize < 0 {
                throw CompressionError(code: Int(compressedSize))
            }
            compressedData.count = compressedSize
        }
    }
    return compressedData
}
```

The `deflateCompress` function takes an input `Data` object and returns the compressed `Data` object. It uses the `compression_encode_buffer` function from the `Compression` framework to perform the actual compression.

### LZFSE Compression

LZFSE is another compression algorithm available in Swift through the `Compression` framework. It provides higher compression speed compared to Deflate, at the cost of a slightly lower compression ratio. Here's an example of how to perform LZFSE compression in Swift:

```swift
import Compression

func lzfseCompress(data: Data) throws -> Data {
    var compressedData = Data(count: data.count)
    try compressedData.withUnsafeMutableBytes { compressedBytes in
        try data.withUnsafeBytes { dataBytes in
            let compressedSize = compression_encode_buffer(compressedBytes.baseAddress!,
                                                          compressedBytes.count,
                                                          dataBytes.baseAddress!,
                                                          dataBytes.count,
                                                          nil,
                                                          COMPRESSION_LZFSE)
            if compressedSize < 0 {
                throw CompressionError(code: Int(compressedSize))
            }
            compressedData.count = compressedSize
        }
    }
    return compressedData
}
```

The `lzfseCompress` function is similar to the `deflateCompress` function but uses the `COMPRESSION_LZFSE` flag to indicate LZFSE compression.

## Decompression

### Deflate Decompression

To decompress a deflate-compressed data using a Swift managed buffer, you can use the `compression_decode_buffer` function from the `Compression` framework. Here's an example:

```swift
import Compression

func deflateDecompress(compressedData: Data) throws -> Data {
    var decompressedData = Data(count: compressedData.count * 4) // Allocate initial buffer
    try decompressedData.withUnsafeMutableBytes { decompressedBytes in
        try compressedData.withUnsafeBytes { compressedBytes in
            var decompressedSize = decompressedData.count
            let decodeResult = compression_decode_buffer(decompressedBytes.baseAddress!,
                                                        decompressedSize,
                                                        compressedBytes.baseAddress!,
                                                        compressedBytes.count,
                                                        nil,
                                                        COMPRESSION_ZLIB)
            if decodeResult != 0 {
                throw CompressionError(code: Int(decodeResult))
            }
            decompressedSize = decodeResult
            decompressedData.count = decompressedSize
        }
    }
    return decompressedData
}
```

The `deflateDecompress` function takes a deflate-compressed `Data` object and returns the decompressed `Data` object. It uses the `compression_decode_buffer` function with the `COMPRESSION_ZLIB` flag to perform the decompression.

### LZFSE Decompression

Similarly, to decompress LZFSE-compressed data, you can use the `compression_decode_buffer` function with the `COMPRESSION_LZFSE` flag. Here's an example:

```swift
import Compression

func lzfseDecompress(compressedData: Data) throws -> Data {
    var decompressedData = Data(count: compressedData.count * 4) // Allocate initial buffer
    try decompressedData.withUnsafeMutableBytes { decompressedBytes in
        try compressedData.withUnsafeBytes { compressedBytes in
            var decompressedSize = decompressedData.count
            let decodeResult = compression_decode_buffer(decompressedBytes.baseAddress!,
                                                        decompressedSize,
                                                        compressedBytes.baseAddress!,
                                                        compressedBytes.count,
                                                        nil,
                                                        COMPRESSION_LZFSE)
            if decodeResult != 0 {
                throw CompressionError(code: Int(decodeResult))
            }
            decompressedSize = decodeResult
            decompressedData.count = decompressedSize
        }
    }
    return decompressedData
}
```

The `lzfseDecompress` function is similar to the `deflateDecompress` function but uses the `COMPRESSION_LZFSE` flag.
