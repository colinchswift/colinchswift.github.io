Guided Access is an accessibility feature in iOS that allows users to focus on a single app by disabling certain hardware buttons and restricting touch input on certain areas of the screen. In this blog post, we will explore how to support Guided Access in your Swift app.

## What is Guided Access?

Guided Access is a feature that can be enabled on an iOS device to limit the functionality of the device to a single app. This is particularly useful in educational or public settings, where you want to restrict the user's access to other apps or features.

When Guided Access is enabled, the user can set specific restrictions such as disabling touch interaction on certain parts of the screen or disabling the home button. The user can also set a passcode to exit Guided Access mode.

## Enabling Guided Access

To support Guided Access in your Swift app, you need to use the `UIAccessibility` framework provided by iOS. First, you need to check if Guided Access is enabled using the `UIAccessibility.isGuidedAccessEnabled` property:

```swift
if UIAccessibility.isGuidedAccessEnabled {
    // Guided Access is enabled
} else {
    // Guided Access is disabled
}
```

Once you have determined the status of Guided Access, you can modify your app's behavior accordingly. For example, you can disable certain UI elements or provide alternative navigation options if Guided Access is enabled.

## Listening for Guided Access Changes

In order to respond to changes in Guided Access status, you can register for the `UIAccessibility.guidedAccessStatusDidChangeNotification` notification:

```swift
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(guidedAccessStatusDidChange), name: UIAccessibility.guidedAccessStatusDidChangeNotification, object: nil)
```

In the selector method, you can update your app's behavior based on the new Guided Access status:

```swift
@objc func guidedAccessStatusDidChange() {
    if UIAccessibility.isGuidedAccessEnabled {
        // Guided Access is enabled
    } else {
        // Guided Access is disabled
    }
}
```

Remember to unregister for the notification when your view controller is deallocated:

```swift
deinit {
    NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(self, name: UIAccessibility.guidedAccessStatusDidChangeNotification, object: nil)
}
```

## Conclusion

Supporting Guided Access in your Swift app can enhance the accessibility and usability of your application, especially for users who rely on this accessibility feature. By checking the Guided Access status and listening for changes, you can adapt your app's behavior and provide a more seamless experience.
