AssistiveTouch is a handy accessibility feature available on iOS devices that allows users with physical disabilities to perform touchscreen actions using a custom on-screen button. In this blog post, we will explore how to support AssistiveTouch in your Swift application.

## Enabling AssistiveTouch

To enable AssistiveTouch on an iOS device, the user typically goes to **Settings > Accessibility > Touch > AssistiveTouch**, and toggles the switch to enable it. Once enabled, the AssistiveTouch button will appear on the screen.

## Detecting AssistiveTouch status

To provide a seamless experience for users who have enabled AssistiveTouch, your app should be aware if AssistiveTouch is enabled or not. You can determine AssistiveTouch status using the `isAssistiveTouchEnabled` property of the `UIAccessibility` class.

```swift
if UIAccessibility.isAssistiveTouchEnabled {
    // AssistiveTouch is enabled
} else {
    // AssistiveTouch is disabled
}
```

## Adding custom actions for AssistiveTouch

If your app has custom gestures or UI elements that may not be easily accessible through AssistiveTouch, you can add custom actions specifically tailored for AssistiveTouch users.

One approach is to create a custom *AccessibilityAction* that can be associated with a specific element or view. For example, let's say we have a button that performs an important action in our app. We can add an *AccessibilityAction* to allow AssistiveTouch users to trigger that action easily.

Here's an example of how you can add a custom **AccessibilityAction**:

```swift
import UIKit

class CustomButton: UIButton {
    override var accessibilityCustomActions: [UIAccessibilityCustomAction]? {
        get {
            let customAction = UIAccessibilityCustomAction(
                name: "Perform Custom Action",
                target: self,
                selector: #selector(performCustomAction)
            )
            return [customAction]
        }
        set {}
    }

    @objc private func performCustomAction() {
        // Perform your custom action here
    }
}
```

By adding the custom action to your button's `accessibilityCustomActions` property, AssistiveTouch users can now trigger the action by tapping on the AssistiveTouch button and selecting the "Perform Custom Action" option.

## Conclusion

By supporting AssistiveTouch in your Swift application, you can provide a more inclusive user experience for individuals who rely on this accessibility feature. Remember to check the AssistiveTouch status using the `isAssistiveTouchEnabled` property and consider adding custom actions for specific UI elements or gestures. This way, your app can be more accessible and user-friendly for everyone.
