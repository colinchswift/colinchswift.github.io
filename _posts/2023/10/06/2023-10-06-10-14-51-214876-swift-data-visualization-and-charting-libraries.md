Data visualization is a crucial aspect of many applications, whether it's displaying sales reports, tracking fitness progress, or analyzing financial data. Swift, Apple's programming language for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS, offers several powerful data visualization and charting libraries that can help you create stunning visual representations of your data. In this article, we will explore some popular Swift libraries for data visualization and charting.

### Charts {#charts}
![Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts/raw/master/Assets/logo%20+%20name.png)

[Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts) is one of the most popular charting libraries available for Swift. It provides a wide range of chart types, including line charts, bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and more. Charts offers extensive customization options, allowing you to configure everything from colors and fonts to axis labels and legends. It also supports animations, gestures, and interactions, making your charts more engaging and interactive.

```swift
import Charts

let chartView = BarChartView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 200, height: 200))

// Configure chart data and appearance
let dataSet = BarChartDataSet(entries: entries)
dataSet.colors = [UIColor.red, UIColor.green, UIColor.blue]
let data = BarChartData(dataSet: dataSet)
chartView.data = data

// Customize axis labels and legend
chartView.xAxis.labelPosition = .bottom
chartView.xAxis.valueFormatter = xAxisFormatter
chartView.legend.enabled = true

// Add chart view to your view hierarchy
view.addSubview(chartView)
```

### Core Plot {#core-plot}
![Core Plot](https://github.com/core-plot/core-plot/raw/master/generator/templates/Images/CorePlot.png)

[Core Plot](https://github.com/core-plot/core-plot) is a highly flexible and feature-rich plotting framework for iOS and macOS. It supports a wide range of chart types, including scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, and more. Core Plot offers extensive customization options, allowing you to control every aspect of your charts, from colors and line styles to axis labels and legends. It also provides advanced features like logarithmic scales and plot interactions.

```swift
import CorePlot

let graphView = CPTGraphHostingView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 200, height: 200))
let graph = CPTXYGraph(frame: graphView.bounds)
graphView.hostedGraph = graph

let dataSet = CPTScatterPlot(plotSpace: graph.defaultPlotSpace)
dataSet.dataSource = self
graph.add(dataSet)

let xAxis = CPTXYAxis()
xAxis.majorIntervalLength = 1.0
graph.axisSet?.axes = [xAxis]

view.addSubview(graphView)
```

### Scrollable Graph View {#scrollable-graph-view}
![Scrollable Graph View](https://github.com/philackm/ScrollableGraphView/raw/master/README_files/header.png)

[Scrollable Graph View](https://github.com/philackm/ScrollableGraphView) is a versatile and customizable graphing library for iOS. It allows you to create scrollable and interactive line graphs, bar graphs, and dot graphs. Scrollable Graph View provides various graph styles, such as curved lines, stacked bars, and dynamic animations. It also supports touch gestures like zooming and panning, making it convenient for exploring and analyzing large datasets.

```swift
import ScrollableGraphView

let graphView = ScrollableGraphView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 200, height: 200))
let linePlot = LinePlot(identifier: "line")
linePlot.lineStyle = .smooth
linePlot.lineColor = UIColor.red
linePlot.lineWidth = 3.0
graphView.addPlot(plot: linePlot)

let barPlot = BarPlot(identifier: "bar")
barPlot.barColor = UIColor.blue
barPlot.barWidth = 25.0
graphView.addPlot(plot: barPlot)

// Configure data and axis labels
graphView.data = data
graphView.xAxis.labels = labels

view.addSubview(graphView)
```

### SwiftCharts {#swiftcharts}
![SwiftCharts](https://github.com/i-schuetz/SwiftCharts/raw/master/resources/Charts.png)

[SwiftCharts](https://github.com/i-schuetz/SwiftCharts) is a modern and powerful charting library for iOS, written purely in Swift. It supports a variety of chart types, including line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, and more. SwiftCharts provides a simple and intuitive API for data configuration and customization. It also offers features like zooming, panning, and selection handlers, allowing users to interact with the charts easily.

```swift
import SwiftCharts

let chart = Chart(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 200, height: 200))
let series = ChartSeries(data: data)
series.area = true
chart.add(series)

chart.xLabels = labels.map { ChartAxisLabel(text: $0, settings: labelSettings) }
chart.yLabels = ChartAxisLabelsGenerator.generateLabelsForRange(min: 0, max: 100, axis: chart.yAxis, formatter: { String(Int($1)) })

view.addSubview(chart)
```

### Conclusion {#conclusion}
These are just a few of the numerous Swift libraries available for data visualization and charting. Each library comes with its own unique features and benefits, providing developers with options for creating visually appealing and interactive charts in their iOS applications. Whether you need basic charting capabilities or advanced customization options, Swift has a library that suits your needs. So go ahead, experiment with these libraries, and bring your data to life with beautiful visualizations!
