Swift is a programming language developed by Apple for building applications for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. While it is commonly used for app development, Swift can also be used for writing simple scripts. In this article, we will explore how to write and run simple scripts in Swift.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have Swift installed on your system. You can download and install the latest version of Xcode, which includes the Swift compiler, from the Mac App Store.

## Creating a Swift Script

To create a Swift script, open your favorite text editor and create a new file with a `.swift` extension. For this example, let's create a script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. 

```swift
#!/usr/bin/env swift

print("Hello, World!")
```

The first line, `#!/usr/bin/env swift`, is known as a shebang and tells the system that this file should be executed using the Swift interpreter.

The next line, `print("Hello, World!")`, is the actual code that prints the message to the console.

Save the file with a meaningful name, such as `hello.swift`.

## Running the Script

To run the Swift script, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is saved. Then, use the following command:

```bash
swift hello.swift
```

This command tells the Swift compiler to execute the script. You should see the output "Hello, World!" printed to the console.

## Passing Command Line Arguments

You can also pass command-line arguments to your Swift script. Update your `hello.swift` script with the following code:

```swift
#!/usr/bin/env swift

if CommandLine.arguments.count > 1 {
    let name = CommandLine.arguments[1]
    print("Hello, \(name)!")
} else {
    print("Hello, World!")
}
```

In this updated script, we check if there are any command-line arguments passed to the script. If there is at least one argument, we print "Hello, [name]!" where [name] is the first argument. If no arguments are provided, we default to printing "Hello, World!".

Save the updated script and run it again using the `swift` command. You can pass your name as a command-line argument like this:

```bash
swift hello.swift John
```

The script will then print "Hello, John!" to the console.

## Conclusion

Writing simple scripts in Swift can be a great way to automate tasks or solve small problems. With the Swift language's simplicity and power, you can quickly create scripts to accomplish various tasks. Whether you're a seasoned Swift developer or just getting started, writing scripts in Swift can be a valuable skill to have in your toolbox.
