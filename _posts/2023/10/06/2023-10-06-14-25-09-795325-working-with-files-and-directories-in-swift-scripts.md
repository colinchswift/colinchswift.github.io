Creating and manipulating files and directories is a common task in scripting and application development. In Swift, there are several ways to work with files and directories, and in this blog post, we will explore some of the useful techniques.

## Checking if a File or Directory Exists

Before performing any operations on a file or directory, it is important to check if it exists. Using the `FileManager` class, we can easily check for the existence of a file or directory.

```swift
import Foundation

let fileManager = FileManager.default

let filePath = "/path/to/file.txt"
var isDirectory: ObjCBool = false

if fileManager.fileExists(atPath: filePath, isDirectory: &isDirectory) {
    if isDirectory.boolValue {
        print("Directory exists")
    } else {
        print("File exists")
    }
} else {
    print("File or directory does not exist")
}
```

## Creating a Directory

To create a directory, we can use the `createDirectory` method of the `FileManager`. We need to specify the directory path and optionally provide attributes like permissions and ownership.

```swift
import Foundation

let fileManager = FileManager.default

let directoryPath = "/path/to/directory"

do {
    try fileManager.createDirectory(atPath: directoryPath, withIntermediateDirectories: true, attributes: nil)
    print("Directory created successfully")
} catch {
    print("Error creating directory: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

## Creating a File

To create a file, we can use the `createFile` method of the `FileManager`. We need to specify the file path and optionally provide attributes like permissions and ownership.

```swift
import Foundation

let fileManager = FileManager.default

let filePath = "/path/to/file.txt"

let fileContent = "Hello, World!"

if fileManager.createFile(atPath: filePath, contents: fileContent.data(using: .utf8), attributes: nil) {
    print("File created successfully")
} else {
    print("Error creating file")
}
```

## Reading From a File

To read the contents of a file, we can use the `String(contentsOfFile:encoding:)` initializer. It reads the contents of the file at the specified path and returns a string.

```swift
import Foundation

let filePath = "/path/to/file.txt"

if let fileContents = try? String(contentsOfFile: filePath, encoding: .utf8) {
    print("File contents: \(fileContents)")
} else {
    print("Error reading file")
}
```

## Writing to a File

To write content to a file, we can use the `write(toFile:atomically:encoding:)` method. It writes the specified string to the file at the given path.

```swift
import Foundation

let filePath = "/path/to/file.txt"
let fileContent = "Hello, World!"

do {
    try fileContent.write(toFile: filePath, atomically: true, encoding: .utf8)
    print("Content written to file")
} catch {
    print("Error writing to file: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

## Deleting a File

To delete a file, we can use the `removeItem(atPath:)` method. It removes the file at the specified path.

```swift
import Foundation

let fileManager = FileManager.default

let filePath = "/path/to/file.txt"

do {
    try fileManager.removeItem(atPath: filePath)
    print("File deleted successfully")
} catch {
    print("Error deleting file: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

## Deleting a Directory

To delete a directory, we can use the `removeItem(atPath:)` method. It removes the directory at the specified path.

```swift
import Foundation

let fileManager = FileManager.default

let directoryPath = "/path/to/directory"

do {
    try fileManager.removeItem(atPath: directoryPath)
    print("Directory deleted successfully")
} catch {
    print("Error deleting directory: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

These are some of the basic operations you can perform with files and directories in Swift scripts. Swift also provides more advanced functionalities like file copying, moving, and permissions management. Explore the Swift Foundation framework documentation to learn more about these features.
