Apple's SiriKit is a powerful framework that allows developers to integrate their apps with Siri, the popular virtual assistant on iOS. It provides a set of APIs and tools to enable natural language interactions with your app, enabling users to perform tasks, such as booking a ride, sending messages, or making a payment, directly through Siri. SiriKit also allows developers to extend their app's functionality by creating custom intents and handling user requests.
