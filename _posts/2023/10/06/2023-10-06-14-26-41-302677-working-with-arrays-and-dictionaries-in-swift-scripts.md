Arrays and dictionaries are powerful data structures in Swift that allow you to store and access collections of data. Whether you're working on a command-line tool or a Swift script, understanding how to use arrays and dictionaries is essential. In this blog post, we'll explore how to work with arrays and dictionaries in Swift scripts.

## Arrays

Arrays in Swift are ordered collections of values of the same type. They can be initialized with a specific type, such as `Int`, `String`, or `Bool`, or even with custom types. Here's an example of creating and working with arrays in a Swift script:

```swift
// Create an empty array of type Int
var numbers = [Int]()

// Add elements to the array
numbers.append(1)
numbers.append(2)
numbers.append(3)

// Access elements in the array
let firstNumber = numbers[0]
let lastNumber = numbers[numbers.count - 1]

// Iterate over the array
for number in numbers {
    print(number)
}
```

In the code snippet above, we first initialize an empty array of type `Int`. We then add elements to the array using the `append` method. We can access elements in the array using the subscript syntax, where the index starts at 0. Finally, we iterate over the array using a `for-in` loop and print each element.

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries in Swift are collections of key-value pairs. They allow you to store and access values based on a unique key. Dictionaries can be created with various types as keys and values. Here's an example of using dictionaries in a Swift script:

```swift
// Create an empty dictionary with String keys and Int values
var scores = [String: Int]()

// Add key-value pairs to the dictionary
scores["John"] = 90
scores["Emily"] = 95
scores["Michael"] = 87

// Access values in the dictionary
let johnScore = scores["John"]
let emilyScore = scores["Emily"]

// Iterate over the dictionary
for (name, score) in scores {
    print("\(name): \(score)")
}
```

In the code snippet above, we initialize an empty dictionary with `String` keys and `Int` values. We then add key-value pairs to the dictionary using the subscript syntax. We can access values in the dictionary using the key. Finally, we iterate over the dictionary using a `for-in` loop and print each key-value pair.

## Conclusion

Working with arrays and dictionaries in Swift scripts is straightforward and essential for managing collections of data. Arrays allow you to store and access ordered collections of values, while dictionaries provide a way to associate a value with a unique key. By leveraging the power of arrays and dictionaries, you can effectively handle and manipulate data in your Swift scripts.
