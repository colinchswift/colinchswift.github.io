In today's mobile app development landscape, creating a hybrid app that combines the best of both worlds - native performance and cross-platform compatibility - has become a popular choice. One such approach is using Swift in combination with React Native.

In this blog post, we will explore the resources available for developing hybrid apps using Swift and React Native. Whether you are a Swift developer looking to explore React Native or a React Native developer wanting to leverage Swift for certain features, these resources will help you get started.

## 1. React Native documentation

To start building hybrid apps with Swift and React Native, it is essential to have a strong understanding of React Native itself. The official React Native documentation is an excellent resource that covers the fundamentals, guides, components, and APIs. It provides detailed explanations along with code examples to help you get started.

## 2. React Native Swift

React Native Swift is a library that allows you to write native Swift code and use it within your React Native projects. It enables you to create Swift modules that can be seamlessly integrated with your React Native components.
