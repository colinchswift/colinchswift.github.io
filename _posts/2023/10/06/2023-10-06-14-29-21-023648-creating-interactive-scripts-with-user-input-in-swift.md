In Swift, you can create interactive scripts that prompt the user for input. This allows you to create more dynamic and personalized experiences for your users. In this blog post, we will explore how to create interactive scripts with user input in Swift.

## Getting User Input
To get user input in Swift, you can use the `readLine()` function. This function reads a line of text from the standard input and returns it as a `String?` optional. 

Here's an example of how to use `readLine()` to get user input:

```swift
print("What's your name?")
if let name = readLine() {
    print("Hello, \(name)!")
}
```

In the example above, the program prompts the user for their name and then uses `readLine()` to store the user's input in the `name` constant. It then prints a welcome message with the user's name.

## Handling User Input
When working with user input, it's important to handle different scenarios, such as empty inputs or inputs that cannot be converted to the desired type. You can use conditional statements and optionals to handle these cases.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to handle different types of user input:

```swift
print("Enter your age:")
if let ageString = readLine(), let age = Int(ageString) {
    if age < 0 {
        print("Invalid age. Please enter a positive number.")
    } else {
        print("You are \(age) years old.")
    }
} else {
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.")
}
```

In the example above, the program prompts the user for their age and tries to convert the input to an integer using `Int()`. If the conversion is successful and the age is a positive number, it prints the age. Otherwise, it displays an error message.

## Example Script
Let's put everything together and write an example script that calculates the sum of two numbers provided by the user:

```swift
print("Enter the first number:")
if let firstNumberString = readLine(), let firstNumber = Double(firstNumberString) {
    print("Enter the second number:")
    if let secondNumberString = readLine(), let secondNumber = Double(secondNumberString) {
        let sum = firstNumber + secondNumber
        print("The sum of \(firstNumber) and \(secondNumber) is \(sum).")
    } else {
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number for the second number.")
    }
} else {
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number for the first number.")
}
```

In the example script above, the program prompts the user for two numbers and calculates their sum. It handles different scenarios such as non-numeric inputs or empty inputs.

By creating interactive scripts with user input in Swift, you can create more engaging and customized experiences for your users. Whether it's a simple calculator or a complex decision-making script, Swift provides the tools you need to handle user input and create interactive applications.
