## Swift Cryptocurrency Libraries
1. **CryptoSwift**: CryptoSwift is a Swift implementation of cryptographic algorithms, including hashing, symmetric encryption, and public-key cryptography. It provides a convenient and secure way to handle cryptographic operations in your cryptocurrency and blockchain applications.

```swift
import CryptoSwift

let message = "Hello, world!"
let key = "SecretKey123"

let encryptedData = try AES(key: key, iv: "1234567890123456").encrypt(Array(message.utf8))
let decryptedData = try AES(key: key, iv: "1234567890123456").decrypt(encryptedData)

print(String(data: Data(decryptedData), encoding: .utf8) ?? "")
```

2. **EthereumKit**: EthereumKit is a Swift framework for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. It provides functionalities for creating Ethereum wallets, sending transactions, and interacting with smart contracts. It is a useful library for building decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum platform.

```swift
import EthereumKit

let keystore = try! EthereumKeystoreV3(password: "password", aesMode: "aes-128-ctr")
let privateKey = try! keystore.UNSAFE_getPrivateKeyData(password: "password", account: keystore.addresses.first!)
let publicKey = AnySigner.PublicKey(data: privateKey)

print(publicKey.address)
```

## Blockchain Development Frameworks
1. **MetrICX SDK**: MetrICX SDK is a Swift framework for developing applications on the ICON blockchain. It provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with the ICON blockchain network, allowing you to create wallets, send transactions, and interact with smart contracts.

2. **StellarSDK**: StellarSDK is a Swift SDK for building applications on the Stellar blockchain platform. With StellarSDK, you can easily create Stellar accounts, send and receive payments, and manage assets on the Stellar network.

## Online Courses and Tutorials
1. **Ray Wenderlich**: Ray Wenderlich offers a comprehensive online course on "Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Programming for iOS". This course covers the basics of blockchain technology, cryptography, and building cryptocurrency applications using Swift.

2. **Hacking with Swift**: Hacking with Swift has a tutorial series on "Building a Decentralized Cryptocurrency App". This tutorial teaches you how to build a cryptocurrency tracking app using Swift, SwiftUI, and the CoinGecko API.

## Developer Communities
1. **r/swift**: The Swift subreddit is a vibrant community of Swift developers. You can find discussions, ask questions, and share your projects related to Swift blockchain and cryptocurrency development.

2. **Stack Overflow**: Stack Overflow is a popular Q&A platform for developers. Search for Swift blockchain or cryptocurrency-related questions, or ask your own questions to get help from the community.

## Conclusion
With the resources mentioned above, you have a solid foundation to start building cryptocurrency and blockchain applications using Swift. Whether you are interested in developing decentralized applications or working with blockchain frameworks, Swift has the tools and libraries to support your development journey. Join the developer communities, explore the online courses, and dive into the Swift cryptocurrency and blockchain development world!
