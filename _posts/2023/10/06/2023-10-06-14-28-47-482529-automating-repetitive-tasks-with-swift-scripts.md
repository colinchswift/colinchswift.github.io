As a developer, you probably find yourself performing repetitive tasks frequently, such as renaming files or generating code templates. Manually completing these tasks can be time-consuming and tedious. However, you can streamline your workflow by automating these repetitive tasks using Swift scripts.

Swift is not only a powerful language for iOS and macOS app development but also a versatile scripting language. In this blog post, we will explore how you can leverage Swift's scripting capabilities to automate various tasks.

## Getting started with Swift scripting

To get started with Swift scripting, you'll need to have Swift installed on your system. Swift comes bundled with Xcode, Apple's integrated development environment, so if you have Xcode installed, you should already have Swift available.

To create a Swift script, open a text editor and create a new file with a `.swift` extension. At the beginning of your script, add the shebang line `#!/usr/bin/env swift` to indicate that the script should be interpreted using Swift.

```swift
#!/usr/bin/env swift

import Foundation

// Your script code goes here
```

## Renaming files with Swift scripts

One common repetitive task is renaming multiple files with a specific pattern. With Swift scripting, we can create a script that renames files using custom rules.

```swift
#!/usr/bin/env swift

import Foundation

func renameFiles(in directory: URL) {
    let fileManager = FileManager.default

    guard let enumerator = fileManager.enumerator(at: directory, includingPropertiesForKeys: nil) else {
        return
    }

    for case let fileURL as URL in enumerator {
        guard let newName = fileURL.lastPathComponent.replacingOccurrences(of: "old_", with: "new_") else {
            continue
        }

        let newFileURL = directory.appendingPathComponent(newName)

        do {
            try fileManager.moveItem(at: fileURL, to: newFileURL)
        } catch {
            print("Error renaming file: \(fileURL.lastPathComponent)")
        }
    }
}

let directoryURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/files")
renameFiles(in: directoryURL)
```

In this example, we define a `renameFiles` function that takes a directory URL as input. It uses `FileManager` to traverse the directory and rename files that match a specific pattern. The `replacingOccurrences` method is used to replace the old prefix with the new prefix in the file name.

You can customize the renaming pattern and directory path to suit your needs. Save this script to a `.swift` file, make it executable using `chmod +x script.swift`, and run it from the command line with `./script.swift`.

## Generating code templates with Swift scripts

Another use case for Swift scripting is generating code templates. For example, you may want to create a script that generates a basic Swift class template with predefined properties and methods.

```swift
#!/usr/bin/env swift

import Foundation

func generateCodeTemplate() {
    let className = "MyClass"
    let properties = ["property1", "property2", "property3"]
    let methods = ["method1", "method2"]

    var template = """
    class \(className) {
        \(properties.map { "var \($0): String?" }.joined(separator: "\n    "))

        \(methods.map { "func \($0)() {\n        // TODO: Implement \($0)\n    }" }.joined(separator: "\n\n    "))}
    }
    """

    print(template)
}

generateCodeTemplate()
```

In this example, we define a `generateCodeTemplate` function that builds a Swift class template using predefined class name, properties, and methods. The template is constructed using multiline string literals, with properties and methods dynamically generated using `map` and `joined` methods.

Running this script will print the generated code template to the console. You can redirect the output to a file using `>`, for example, `./script.swift > MyClass.swift`.

## Conclusion

Swift scripting is a powerful tool that allows you to automate repetitive tasks and streamline your development workflow. From renaming files to generating code templates, Swift scripts can save you time and effort.

Remember to make your script executable by using `chmod +x` and running it from the command line. Experiment with different tasks and customize the scripts to suit your specific requirements.

Now you can leverage the power of Swift not only for iOS and macOS app development but also for automating repetitive tasks in your day-to-day work! #Swift #Automation
