In iOS app development, handling in-app purchases is a common requirement. However, it's crucial to ensure proper memory management and deallocation of objects related to in-app purchase handling to prevent memory leaks and improve overall app performance.

When implementing in-app purchases, there are several objects involved, such as the StoreKit framework's classes like `SKPaymentQueue` and `SKProductsRequestDelegate`. To ensure proper deallocation of these objects, follow these guidelines:

## 1. Remove Observers and Delegates

When your view controller or object that handles in-app purchases is about to be deallocated, make sure to remove itself as an observer and delegate from the related objects.

For example, if you were observing transactions using the `SKPaymentQueue` in your view controller, remove the observer in the `deinit` method or when it's no longer needed:

```swift
deinit {
    SKPaymentQueue.default().remove(self)
}
```

Similarly, if you were assigned as the delegate for `SKProductsRequest`, make sure to set `delegate` to `nil` before the object gets deallocated:

```swift
productsRequest.delegate = nil
```

## 2. Handle Memory Warnings

In situations where your app receives a memory warning, it's essential to clean up any unnecessary resources related to in-app purchase handling. This could include canceling ongoing requests, clearing caches, or disposing of any temporary objects.

Implement the `didReceiveMemoryWarning` method in your view controller and perform the necessary cleanup:

```swift
override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
    super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
    // Release any cached data, invalidate ongoing requests, etc.
    // related to in-app purchase handling
}
```

## 3. Implement ARC Safely

If you're using Automatic Reference Counting (ARC), deallocating objects is typically automated. However, it's still important to ensure that strongly held references to objects related to in-app purchase handling are appropriately released when they are no longer needed.

Avoid creating strong reference cycles by using weak or unowned references when appropriate, especially when working with closures or retaining self within an object that might not get deallocated right away.

Consider using `[weak self]` or `[unowned self]` in closures where `self` might create a strong reference cycle, like:

```swift
SKPaymentQueue.default().add(payment) { [weak self] transaction in
    guard let self = self else { return }
    // Handle transaction here
}
```

Following these guidelines will help ensure proper deallocation of objects related to in-app purchase handling, reducing the risk of memory leaks and improving the overall performance of your iOS app.
