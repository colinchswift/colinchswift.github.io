When working with URL loading in Swift, it is essential to properly release any objects related to URL loading to prevent memory leaks. One common approach to achieve this is by releasing these objects in the `deinit()` method of your class.

Let's say you have a class that handles URL loading, and you have created objects such as `URLSession`, `URLSessionDataTask`, or `URLSessionDownloadTask`. To ensure proper memory management, you should release these objects in the `deinit()` method when they are no longer needed.

```swift
class URLLoader {
    var session: URLSession?
    var dataTask: URLSessionDataTask?
    
    init() {
        // Initialize URLSession and other necessary objects
        session = URLSession(configuration: URLSessionConfiguration.default)
    }
    
    func loadData(from url: URL) {
        dataTask = session?.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in
            // Handle data loading
        }
        
        dataTask?.resume()
    }
    
    deinit {
        // Release objects related to URL loading
        dataTask?.cancel()
        session = nil
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `session` and `dataTask` objects are properly released in the `deinit()` method. This ensures that when an instance of `URLLoader` is no longer needed, these objects are deallocated and the associated memory is released.

It is important to note that if you are using iOS 13 or later, you can take advantage of Combine framework and its `URLSession.DataTaskPublisher` to handle URL loading. Combine framework automatically handles memory management, so you don't need to explicitly release objects in `deinit()` in such cases.

By properly releasing objects related to URL loading in the `deinit()` method, you can ensure efficient memory management and prevent any potential memory leaks in your application.

For more information on URL loading in Swift, you can refer to the official Apple documentation: [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession) and [URLSessionDataTask](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessiondatatask).
