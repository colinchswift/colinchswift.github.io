When developing applications with gesture handling functionality, it is important to ensure that all objects related to gesture handling are properly deallocated to avoid memory leaks and optimize the performance of your application. In this blog post, we will discuss the best practices for deallocating objects related to gesture handling.

## Introduction

Gesture handling is an integral part of many applications, enabling users to interact with the user interface through gestures like tapping, swiping, pinching, etc. While implementing gesture handling, developers often create objects such as gesture recognizers and gesture handlers to handle specific gestures. These objects need to be properly deallocated when they are no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.

## Identifying Gesture Handling Objects

Before deallocating gesture handling objects, it is important to first identify the objects related to gesture handling within your application. Some common types of objects include:

- Gesture Recognizers: Objects that recognize specific gesture patterns, such as UITapGestureRecognizer, UIPanGestureRecognizer, etc.
- Gesture Handlers: Objects that handle gestures once they are recognized, usually implemented by implementing gesture handling methods.

By identifying these objects, you can ensure that all the necessary objects are deallocated properly.

## Deallocating Gesture Recognizers

To deallocate gesture recognizers, you should follow these best practices:

1. Remove Gesture Recognizers: Before deallocation, make sure to remove the gesture recognizer from the view or control it was added to. This can be done by calling the `removeGestureRecognizer(_:)` method on the corresponding view or control.
2. Set Gesture Recognizer Objects to `nil`: Set the reference to the gesture recognizer object to `nil` after removing it from the view or control.

Here's an example in Swift:

```swift
// Remove gesture recognizer
view.removeGestureRecognizer(tapGestureRecognizer)

// Set reference to nil
tapGestureRecognizer = nil
```

By following these steps, you ensure that the gesture recognizer object is properly deallocated.

## Deallocating Gesture Handlers

Similar to gesture recognizers, gesture handlers must also be deallocated correctly. Here are some best practices:

1. Remove the Gesture Handler: Remove any reference to the gesture handler from the view or control that it was assigned to, similar to removing gesture recognizers.
2. Set Gesture Handler Objects to `nil`: Set the reference to the gesture handler object to `nil` after removing it from the view or control.

Here's an example in Swift:

```swift
// Remove gesture handler
view.gestureHandler = nil
```

By properly removing and setting the reference to `nil`, you ensure that the gesture handler object is deallocated.

## Conclusion

Proper memory management is crucial when it comes to gesture handling in your application. By following these best practices, you can ensure that objects related to gesture handling are deallocated correctly, avoiding memory leaks and optimizing your application's performance.

Remember to always remove gesture recognizers and gesture handlers from their corresponding views or controls before setting their references to `nil`. With these steps in mind, you can handle gesture handling objects efficiently in your application.
