In Swift, closures are powerful tools that can capture and store references to objects and variables. However, when capturing objects by a closure, we need to be mindful of the strong reference cycles that can occur. One scenario where this becomes important is when we are capturing objects that need to be deinitialized explicitly. In this blog post, we will explore how to deinitialize objects captured by closures using capture lists in Swift.

## Strong reference cycles and memory leaks

Before diving into capture lists, let's understand why strong reference cycles can lead to memory leaks. In Swift, objects hold references to other objects, forming a reference graph. When two objects have strong references to each other, a strong reference cycle is created. In such cases, even when we expect an object to be deallocated, it remains in memory because the reference count never reaches zero.

## Capturing objects by closure

When we capture an object by a closure, Swift creates a strong reference to the object, which increases the reference count. This is the default behavior and can lead to reference cycles. To prevent this, we can use weak or unowned references in the capture list.

### Weak capture

A weak capture means that the closure will hold a weak reference to the captured object. This prevents a strong reference cycle since weak references do not increase the reference count. However, we need to handle the possibility of the captured object being deallocated, as weak references can become nil.

Example:

```swift
class MyClass {
    var completionHandler: (() -> Void)?

    func performTask() {
        completionHandler = { [weak self] in
            guard let self = self else { return }
            print("Task completed by \(self)")
        }
        completionHandler?()
    }
}

let instance = MyClass()
instance.performTask()
```

In the above example, we capture `self` weakly in the closure. Inside the closure, we use optional binding to safely unwrap the weak reference before accessing it.

### Unowned capture

An unowned capture means that the closure will hold an unowned reference to the captured object. Unlike weak references, unowned references are assumed to always have a value. This means we don't need to handle the possibility of the captured object being deallocated.

Example:

```swift
class MyClass {
    var completionHandler: (() -> Void)?

    func performTask() {
        completionHandler = { [unowned self] in
            print("Task completed by \(self)")
        }
        completionHandler?()
    }
}

let instance = MyClass()
instance.performTask()
```

In the above example, we capture `self` unowned in the closure. Since we are certain that the closure will not outlive the captured object, we can safely access `self` without any optional binding.

## Summary

In Swift, capturing objects by closures can potentially create strong reference cycles and memory leaks. By using capture lists and choosing weak or unowned references appropriately, we can avoid strong reference cycles and ensure explicit deinitialization of captured objects. This is a crucial aspect of memory management in Swift and can significantly improve the performance and efficiency of our applications.
