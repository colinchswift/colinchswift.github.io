When working with web services in iOS, we often use URLSession to handle network requests. However, if we don't properly deallocate URLSession instances, it can lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior in our app. 

In this blog post, we will discuss the importance of properly deallocating URL sessions and how to do it correctly in the deinit() method of our classes.

## Understanding URLSession Deallocations

URLSession is a powerful class that manages all the network requests sent to a server. It uses system resources and establishes connections to external services. Failing to deallocate a URLSession instance properly can result in wasted resources, increased memory usage, and even crashes.

When an instance of a class that contains URLSession is deallocated, it's essential to cancel any pending tasks and invalidate the session to release its associated resources.

## Deallocating URLSession in deinit()

The deinit() method is called when an object is about to be deallocated. It provides an ideal place to clean up resources associated with the object, including the URLSession.

To properly deallocate URLSession in deinit(), follow these steps:

1. Create a URLSession instance as a property of your class.
```swift
class NetworkingManager {
    var urlSession: URLSession!

    // ... your code ...
}
```

2. Initialize the URLSession in the init() method or wherever it fits your logic.
```swift
init() {
    urlSession = URLSession(configuration: .default)
}
```

3. In the deinit() method, cancel any pending tasks and invalidate the URLSession.
```swift
deinit {
    urlSession.invalidateAndCancel()
}
```

By calling `invalidateAndCancel()` on the URLSession instance, we ensure that any ongoing requests are canceled, and the session is properly closed, releasing all its associated resources.

## Conclusion

Properly deallocating URL sessions is a crucial step in managing network requests in iOS apps. Not doing so can lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior. By implementing the steps outlined in this blog post and deallocating the URLSession in the deinit() method of your class, you can ensure efficient resource management in your app.

Remember to always inspect your code and ensure that URLSession instances are deallocated properly, especially in classes that might persist throughout the app's lifecycle.
