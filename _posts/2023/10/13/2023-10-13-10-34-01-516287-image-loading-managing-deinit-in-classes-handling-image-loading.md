When working with image loading in Swift, it is important to ensure proper memory management. One common issue that can arise is related to handling the `deinit` method in classes responsible for image loading.

### The Problem
In many cases, image loading is done asynchronously, meaning that the image loading process might not complete immediately. This can lead to a situation where the class responsible for image loading gets deallocated before the image finishes loading. When that happens, the completion handler or delegate methods might be called on a deallocated instance, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior in the application.

### Solution: Weak References
A recommended approach to handle this issue is by using weak references in the class responsible for image loading. By making the references to the delegate or completion handlers weak, we prevent the retain cycle that could potentially prevent the class from being deallocated.

Let's take a look at an example to illustrate this solution:

```swift
class ImageLoader {

    weak var delegate: ImageLoaderDelegate?
    private var completionHandler: ((UIImage?) -> Void)?

    func loadImage(from url: URL) {
        // Perform image loading asynchronously
        DispatchQueue.global().async {
            // Simulating network request and image loading delay
            Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 2)
            
            // Once the image is loaded,
            // call the delegate or completion handler
            DispatchQueue.main.async { [weak self] in
                guard let self = self else { return }
                let image = UIImage(named: "placeholder")
                self.delegate?.imageLoader(self, didFinishLoading: image)
                self.completionHandler?(image)
            }
        }
    }

    deinit {
        print("ImageLoader deallocated")
    }
}

protocol ImageLoaderDelegate: AnyObject {
    func imageLoader(_ loader: ImageLoader, didFinishLoading image: UIImage?)
}
```

In this example, the `ImageLoader` class has a weak reference to its delegate and a weak reference to the completion handler. This ensures that if the delegate or completion handler gets deallocated before the image loading completes, the class doesn't retain it and avoids a retain cycle.

### Conclusion
Managing `deinit` in classes handling image loading is crucial to avoid crashes and unexpected behavior. By using weak references to delegates and completion handlers, we can ensure proper memory management and prevent retain cycles.
