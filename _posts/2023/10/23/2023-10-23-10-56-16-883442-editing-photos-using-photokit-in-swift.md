In this tutorial, we will learn how to edit photos using the PhotoKit framework in Swift. PhotoKit is a powerful framework provided by Apple that allows developers to work with photos and videos in iOS and macOS applications.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you will need:
- Xcode installed on your Mac (you can download it from the App Store)
- Basic knowledge of Swift programming language
- An iOS device or simulator to run the app

## Getting Started
1. Open Xcode and create a new project.
2. Choose "Single View App" as the project template and give it a name.
3. Import the PhotoKit framework by adding `import Photos` at the top of your view controller file.

## Fetching and Displaying a Photo
Before we can edit a photo, we need to fetch and display it in our app. To do this, we will use the `PHImageManager` class from the PhotoKit framework.

```swift
func fetchAndDisplayPhoto() {
    let fetchOptions = PHFetchOptions()
    fetchOptions.sortDescriptors = [NSSortDescriptor(key: "creationDate", ascending: false)]
    let fetchResult = PHAsset.fetchAssets(with: .image, options: fetchOptions)
    
    if let asset = fetchResult.firstObject {
        let imageSize = CGSize(width: asset.pixelWidth, height: asset.pixelHeight)
        let imageOptions = PHImageRequestOptions()
        imageOptions.deliveryMode = .highQualityFormat
        
        PHImageManager.default().requestImage(for: asset, targetSize: imageSize, contentMode: .aspectFill, options: imageOptions) { (image, _) in
            if let image = image {
                // Display the fetched image in your app's interface
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This function fetches the most recent image in the user's photo library and displays it in the app's interface.

## Editing the Photo
Once we have the image displayed, we can start editing it using the available editing tools provided by the framework. The editing tools include cropping, rotating, adjusting brightness, contrast, and more.

Here's an example of how to crop the image:

```swift
func cropImage(image: UIImage, toRect rect: CGRect) -> UIImage? {
    let rectTransform = image.cgImage!.transformForOrientation(image.size)
    let transformedRect = rect.applying(rectTransform)
    let imageRef = image.cgImage!.cropping(to: transformedRect)
    let croppedImage = UIImage(cgImage: imageRef!, scale: image.scale, orientation: image.imageOrientation)
    return croppedImage
}
```

You can modify the `cropImage` function according to your editing requirements.

## Saving the Edited Photo
After editing the photo, we can save the edited version back to the user's photo library using the `PHPhotoLibrary` class.

```swift
func saveEditedPhoto(image: UIImage) {
    PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges({
        PHAssetChangeRequest.creationRequestForAsset(from: image)
    }) { (success, error) in
        if success {
            // Show a success message to the user
        } else {
            // Show an error message to the user
        }
    }
}
```

This function creates a change request to save the edited image as a new asset in the photo library. If the saving process is successful, a success message is shown to the user. Otherwise, an error message is displayed.

## Conclusion
PhotoKit provides a powerful set of tools for editing photos in iOS apps. In this tutorial, we learned how to fetch and display a photo, edit it using various editing functions, and save the edited version back to the user's photo library. This is just a starting point, and you can explore more features and functionality provided by the PhotoKit framework to enhance your photo editing app.

Happy coding!
