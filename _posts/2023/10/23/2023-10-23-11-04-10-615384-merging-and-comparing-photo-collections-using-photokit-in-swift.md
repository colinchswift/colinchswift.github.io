Photo collections can accumulate over time, resulting in duplicate and similar photos. To efficiently manage and organize these collections, it becomes necessary to merge and compare the photos. In this blog post, we will explore how to accomplish this using PhotoKit in Swift.

## Introduction to PhotoKit<a name="introduction-to-photokit"></a>

PhotoKit is a powerful framework provided by Apple for working with photos on iOS and macOS. It allows developers to access the user's photo library, fetch and modify assets, and perform various operations on collections of photos.

To get started, make sure to add the `Photos` framework to your project and import it in your Swift file:

```swift
import Photos
```

## Merging Photo Collections<a name="merging-photo-collections"></a>

Merging photo collections involves combining multiple collections into a single collection. To achieve this, we will use the `PHCollectionList` class provided by PhotoKit.

First, fetch the collections that need to be merged using `PHCollectionList.fetchCollections(in:options:)`:

```swift
let collectionFetchResult = PHCollectionList.fetchCollections(in: PHCollectionListType.momentList, subtype: .momentListCluster, options: nil)
```

Next, create a new collection using `PHAssetCollectionChangeRequest.creationRequestForAssetCollection(withTitle:)`:

```swift
let mergerName = "Merged Collection"
guard let mergerChangeRequest = PHAssetCollectionChangeRequest.creationRequestForAssetCollection(withTitle: mergerName) else {
    return
}
```

Now, iterate over the fetched collections and add each collection's assets to the new merged collection:

```swift
collectionFetchResult.enumerateObjects { (collection, _, _) in
    guard let assetCollection = collection as?
            PHAssetCollection else {
        return
    }
    let collectionAssets = PHAsset.fetchAssets(in: assetCollection, options: nil)
    collectionAssets.enumerateObjects { (asset, _, _) in
        mergerChangeRequest.addAssets(asset)
    }
}
```

Finally, save the changes made to the photo library:

```swift
PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges({
    PHAssetCollectionChangeRequest.startAssetCollectionCreationRequest(with: mergerChangeRequest.placeholderForCreatedAssetCollection!)
}) { (_, _) in
    // Completion Handler
}
```

## Comparing Photo Collections<a name="comparing-photo-collections"></a>

Comparing photo collections involves identifying and retrieving similar or duplicate photos within a collection. PhotoKit offers the `PHAsset` class to work with individual photos and identify their similarity using `PHImageManager`.

To compare two photos, obtain their representative thumbnails using `PHImageManager.requestImage(for:targetSize:contentMode:options:resultHandler:)`:

```swift
let options = PHImageRequestOptions()
options.isNetworkAccessAllowed = true

PHImageManager.default().requestImage(
    for: photoA,
    targetSize: CGSize(width: 100, height: 100),
    contentMode: .aspectFit,
    options: options
) { (thumbnailA, info) in
    PHImageManager.default().requestImage(
        for: photoB,
        targetSize: CGSize(width: 100, height: 100),
        contentMode: .aspectFit,
        options: options
    ) { (thumbnailB, info) in
        // Compare the thumbnails
        if thumbnailA.isEqual(thumbnailB) {
            // Photos are similar
        } else {
            // Photos are different
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>

Photo management is an essential aspect of any photo-based application. With PhotoKit and Swift, merging and comparing photo collections becomes a seamless task. By leveraging the provided APIs, you can efficiently manage photos and enhance the organization and quality of your application.
