## Introduction

PhotoKit is a powerful framework introduced by Apple in iOS 8 for managing and manipulating photos in an iOS app. It provides a high-level API that allows developers to easily fetch, modify, and display photos and albums.

In order to work with PhotoKit, you'll need to import the `Photos` framework in your project:

```swift
import Photos
```

## Fetching Albums

To fetch albums using PhotoKit, we can use the `PHAssetCollection` and `PHAssetCollectionType` classes. 

To fetch all albums, you can use the `PHAssetCollection.fetchAssetCollections(with:options:)` method:

```swift
let allAlbums = PHAssetCollection.fetchAssetCollections(with: .album, subtype: .any, options: nil)
```

The `fetchAssetCollections(with:options:)` method returns a collection of `PHAssetCollection` instances that match the specified criteria. In this case, we're fetching all albums of type `.album`.

To fetch only the user's favorites, you can use the `PHAssetCollection.fetchAssetCollections(with:options:)` method with `PHAssetCollectionSubtype.smartAlbumFavorites` as the subtype:

```swift
let favoriteAlbums = PHAssetCollection.fetchAssetCollections(with: .album, subtype: .smartAlbumFavorites, options: nil)
```

You can also fetch albums based on other subtypes such as `PHAssetCollectionSubtype.smartAlbumVideos` for videos or `PHAssetCollectionSubtype.smartAlbumSelfPortraits` for self-portraits.
