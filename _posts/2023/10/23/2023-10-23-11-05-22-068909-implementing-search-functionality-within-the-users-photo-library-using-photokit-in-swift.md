## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will learn how to implement search functionality to enable users to search for specific photos within their photo library using PhotoKit in Swift. PhotoKit is a powerful framework provided by Apple that allows developers to access and manipulate photos and videos on iOS devices.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Swift programming language and Xcode, along with a development environment set up.

## Step 1: Import the PhotoKit framework
First, we need to import the PhotoKit framework in our project. Open your project in Xcode and navigate to the file where you want to implement the search functionality. Add the following import statement at the top of the file:

```swift
import Photos
```

## Step 2: Request authorization to access the photo library
Before we can access the user's photo library, we need to request authorization. Add the following code snippet to your file:

```swift
PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization { (status) in
    if status == .authorized {
        // Permission granted, proceed with accessing the photo library
    } else {
        // Permission denied, handle the error
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Implement the search functionality
To implement the search functionality, we will use the `PHFetchOptions` and `PHFetchResult` classes provided by PhotoKit. Add the following code snippet after the permission is granted:

```swift
let fetchOptions = PHFetchOptions()
fetchOptions.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "mediaType = %d", PHAssetMediaType.image.rawValue)

let fetchResult = PHAsset.fetchAssets(with: fetchOptions)
```

In the above code snippet, we create a `PHFetchOptions` instance and set a predicate to filter only the photos (`PHAssetMediaType.image`). Then, we use `PHAsset.fetchAssets(with: fetchOptions)` to fetch the assets that match the given criteria.

## Step 4: Perform a search
To perform a search based on user input, you can modify the `fetchOptions.predicate` according to your search logic. For example, if you want to search for photos with a specific date range, you can use the following code snippet:

```swift
let startDate = // The start date of the range
let endDate = // The end date of the range

fetchOptions.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "creationDate >= %@ && creationDate <= %@", startDate as NSDate, endDate as NSDate)
```

You can customize the predicate to match your search requirements.

## Step 5: Display the search results
Once you have fetched the search results, you can display them in your user interface. Iterate over the `fetchResult` and retrieve the corresponding images or display the photo metadata.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have learned how to implement search functionality within the user's photo library using PhotoKit in Swift. We covered how to request authorization, perform a search based on user input, and display the search results. PhotoKit provides a powerful set of tools to work with photos and videos, allowing you to create rich and interactive experiences for your users.
