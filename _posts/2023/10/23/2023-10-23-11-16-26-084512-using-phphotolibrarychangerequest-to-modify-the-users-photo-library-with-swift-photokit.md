## Introduction
PhotoKit is a powerful framework provided by Apple that allows developers to access and modify the user's photo library. One of the key components of PhotoKit is `PHPhotoLibraryChangeRequest`, which enables us to make changes to the photo library in a transactional manner.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you will need:
- Xcode installed on your machine
- Basic knowledge of Swift programming language

## Modifying the Photo Library
To modify the user's photo library, we need to perform the following steps:
1. Request authorization to access the photo library.
2. Create a `PHPhotoLibrary` instance.
3. Use `performChanges` method of `PHPhotoLibrary` to update the library within a change block.

Let's explore different ways of modifying the library using `PHPhotoLibraryChangeRequest`.

## Adding Photos
To add photos to the user's photo library, we can use the `PHAssetChangeRequest.creationRequestForAsset` method. This method allows us to create a new photo and add it to the library.

Here's an example code snippet that illustrates how to add a photo to the library:

```swift
let imageData = UIImage(named: "myPhoto.jpg")!.jpegData(compressionQuality: 1.0)
PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges({
    let creationRequest = PHAssetChangeRequest.creationRequestForAsset(from: imageData!)
    let assetPlaceholder = creationRequest.placeholderForCreatedAsset
}, completionHandler: { success, error in
    if success {
        print("Photo added successfully")
    } else {
        print("Error adding photo: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "")")
    }
})
```

## Deleting Photos
To delete photos from the user's photo library, we can use the `PHAssetChangeRequest.deleteAssets` method. This method allows us to specify the assets that should be deleted.

Here's an example code snippet that illustrates how to delete a photo from the library:

```swift
let photoToDelete = // PHAsset representing the photo to delete
PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges({
    PHAssetChangeRequest.deleteAssets([photoToDelete] as NSArray)
}, completionHandler: { success, error in
    if success {
        print("Photo deleted successfully")
    } else {
        print("Error deleting photo: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "")")
    }
})
```

## Updating Photo Metadata
To update metadata of a photo in the user's photo library, we can use the `PHAssetChangeRequest`'s `contentEditingOutput` property. This property allows us to modify the metadata of the photo.

Here's an example code snippet that illustrates how to update the metadata of a photo:

```swift
let photoToUpdate = // PHAsset representing the photo to update
PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges({
    let changeRequest = PHAssetChangeRequest(for: photoToUpdate)
    changeRequest.creationDate = newCreationDate
    // Make any other desired metadata changes
}, completionHandler: { success, error in
    if success {
        print("Metadata updated successfully")
    } else {
        print("Error updating metadata: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "")")
    }
})
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to use `PHPhotoLibraryChangeRequest` to modify the user's photo library using Swift's PhotoKit framework. We explored different operations such as adding photos, deleting photos, and updating photo metadata.

With PhotoKit, developers have the power to interact with and manipulate the user's photo library seamlessly within their applications.
