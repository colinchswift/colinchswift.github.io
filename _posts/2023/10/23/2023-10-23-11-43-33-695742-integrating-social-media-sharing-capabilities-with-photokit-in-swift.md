## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Social media sharing is a common feature in many iOS applications. With PhotoKit, we can easily select and retrieve photos from the user's photo library. To add the social media sharing capability, we'll integrate with the iOS system sharing sheet to allow users to share selected photos on various social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and more.

## Setting up PhotoKit <a name="setting-up-photokit"></a>
First, we need to set up PhotoKit in our project. Follow these steps to add it to your Swift project:

1. Open your project in Xcode.
2. Select your project in the Project Navigator.
3. Go to the "General" tab and scroll down to the "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" section.
4. Click on the "+" button and search for "Photos.framework".
5. Select "Photos.framework" and click on "Add".

Now that we have PhotoKit set up, we can proceed to implement the social media sharing capabilities.

## Implementing Social Media Sharing <a name="implementing-social-media-sharing"></a>
To implement social media sharing, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Import the necessary frameworks:
   ```swift
   import UIKit
   import Photos
   ```

2. Retrieve the selected photo from PhotoKit:
   ```swift
   func getSelectedPhoto(completion: @escaping (UIImage?) -> Void) {
       // Use PhotoKit to retrieve the selected photo
       // Implement the logic to retrieve the photo here
       // After retrieving, call the completion block with the retrieved photo
       completion(photo)
   }
   ```

3. Implement the share button action:
   ```swift
   @IBAction func shareButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
       getSelectedPhoto { photo in
           guard let photo = photo else {
               return
           }

           // Create an activity view controller
           let activityViewController = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: [photo], applicationActivities: nil)

           // Present the activity view controller
           self.present(activityViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
       }
   }
   ```

4. Run the app and test the social media sharing feature.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
Integrating social media sharing capabilities with PhotoKit in Swift is a great way to allow users to share photos from their photo library with ease. By leveraging the power of PhotoKit and the iOS system sharing sheet, you can provide a seamless sharing experience in your iOS app.

Now you can enhance your app by adding social media sharing capabilities using PhotoKit in Swift. Enjoy coding and explore the possibilities!
