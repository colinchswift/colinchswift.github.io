With the advancements in iOS development, it has become easier than ever to work with media files on a user's device. One such capability is the ability to fetch and display videos from the user's library using the PhotoKit framework.

PhotoKit provides a powerful set of APIs that allows developers to access and manage photos and videos stored in the user's iCloud Photos or on their device's local storage. In this blog post, we will focus on fetching and displaying videos using PhotoKit.

## Introduction to PhotoKit

PhotoKit is a framework that provides a high-level API for accessing and working with the user's photos and videos. It offers a unified approach to access media assets, albums, and metadata, making it easier for developers to integrate media functionalities into their apps.

## Fetching Videos

To fetch videos from the user's library, we need to use the `PHAsset` class provided by PhotoKit. The `PHAsset` class represents a single photo or video in the user's library.

To begin, we need to request the user's permission to access their photo library. This can be done using the `PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization()` method. Once the user grants permission, we can fetch the videos using the `PHAsset.fetchAssets(with:options:)` method.

```swift
import Photos

PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization { status in
    if status == .authorized {
        let options = PHFetchOptions()
        options.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "mediaType = %d", PHAssetMediaType.video.rawValue)
        let fetchResult = PHAsset.fetchAssets(with: options)
        
        // Process the fetched videos
    }
}
```

In the code snippet above, we request authorization to access the photo library. If the user grants permission, we create a fetch options object and set a predicate to fetch only videos. The `PHAsset.fetchAssets(with:options:)` method is then used to retrieve the video assets.

## Displaying Videos

Once we have fetched the videos, we can display them in our app's UI. PhotoKit provides the `PHImageManager` class to handle image and video requests.

To display a video, we need to request its playback asset using the `PHImageManager.requestPlayerItem(for:options:resultHandler:)` method. The result is passed to a completion handler where we can use it to configure our video player, whether it's a custom player or an AVPlayerViewController.

Here's an example of how to display a video using AVPlayerViewController:

```swift
import AVKit

let asset = fetchResult.firstObject
if let videoAsset = asset as? PHAsset {
    PHImageManager.default().requestPlayerItem(forVideo: videoAsset, options: nil) { playerItem, _ in
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            let player = AVPlayer(playerItem: playerItem)
            let playerViewController = AVPlayerViewController()
            playerViewController.player = player
            self.present(playerViewController, animated: true) {
                player.play()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the code snippet above, we access the first video in the fetch result and request its player item using `PHImageManager.requestPlayerItem(forVideo:options:resultHandler:)`. We then create an instance of `AVPlayer` and `AVPlayerViewController` to play and present the video respectively.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to fetch and display videos from the user's library using the PhotoKit framework in iOS development. PhotoKit provides a straightforward API to access media files and enables developers to build powerful media-related features in their apps.

By utilizing the capabilities of PhotoKit, you can create engaging and interactive experiences that leverage the user's personal media library.
