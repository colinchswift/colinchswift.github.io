Managing and editing a large number of photos can be a time-consuming task. Thankfully, with the help of Apple's PhotoKit framework, you can automate bulk editing and perform batch operations on photos in your iOS or macOS app.

PhotoKit provides a comprehensive set of APIs that allow you to work with photos and videos in the user's Photos library. This includes the ability to fetch, edit, and save changes to photos, as well as perform batch operations.

## Fetching Photos

To perform bulk editing or batch operations on photos, you first need to fetch the desired collection of photos from the user's library. PhotoKit provides a powerful `PHFetchOptions` class that allows you to filter photos based on various criteria such as date, location, or media type.

For example, to fetch all the photos taken in the last week, you can use the following code:

```swift
let fetchOptions = PHFetchOptions()
fetchOptions.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "creationDate > %@", Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: -7 * 24 * 60 * 60))

let fetchResult = PHAsset.fetchAssets(with: .image, options: fetchOptions)
```

This will give you a `PHFetchResult` object containing all the photos matching the specified criteria.

## Editing Photos

Once you have fetched the desired photos, you can perform bulk editing operations on them. PhotoKit provides a wide range of editing capabilities, including adjusting brightness, contrast, cropping, applying filters, and more.

To edit a photo, you need to obtain an instance of `PHContentEditingInput` and apply the desired modifications using a `PHContentEditingOutput` object. Here's an example of how you can adjust the brightness of a photo:

```swift
let photo = fetchResult.object(at: index) // Assuming you have a reference to a specific photo

photo.requestContentEditingInput(with: nil) { (contentEditingInput, _) in
    guard let input = contentEditingInput else { return }

    let output = PHContentEditingOutput(contentEditingInput: input)

    // Perform the desired modifications on input.displaySizeImageURL

    // Save the modified image data to output.renderedContentURL

    PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges({
        let request = PHAssetChangeRequest(for: photo)
        request.contentEditingOutput = output
    }, completionHandler: { success, error in
        if success {
            print("Photo edited successfully!")
        } else {
            print("Failed to edit photo: \(String(describing: error))")
        }
    })
}
```

## Batch Operations

With PhotoKit, you can also perform batch operations on multiple photos simultaneously. This is especially useful when you want to apply the same modifications to a set of photos, such as applying a filter or resizing.

To perform a batch operation, you can use the `PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges` method along with `PHAssetChangeRequest`. Here's an example of how you can apply a filter to a set of photos:

```swift
PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges({
    for asset in fetchResult {
        let request = PHAssetChangeRequest(for: asset)
        // Apply the desired filter
    }
}, completionHandler: { success, error in
    if success {
        print("Batch operation completed successfully!")
    } else {
        print("Failed to complete batch operation: \(String(describing: error))")
    }
})
```

## Conclusion

Using PhotoKit in your iOS or macOS app, you can easily perform bulk editing and batch operations on photos. Whether you need to adjust the brightness of multiple images or apply filters to a set of photos, the PhotoKit framework provides powerful APIs to automate these tasks.

By taking advantage of PhotoKit's fetching, editing, and batch operation capabilities, you can streamline your photo management workflows and provide a better user experience in your app.
