Photos play a significant role in our lives, allowing us to capture and immortalize precious moments. With the advancements in technology, we now have the power to enhance and transform our photos using various filters and effects.

In this blog post, we will explore how to apply filters and effects to photos programmatically using Apple's PhotoKit framework.

## Introduction to PhotoKit

PhotoKit is a framework provided by Apple for working with photos and videos. It provides a consistent and efficient way to access, fetch, and edit media assets in the Photos app.

### Adding the PhotoKit framework to your project

To get started, you need to add the PhotoKit framework to your Xcode project. Here's how:

1. Open your project in Xcode.
2. Go to your project's target settings.
3. Select the "General" tab.
4. Scroll down to the "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" section.
5. Click on the "+" button.
6. Search for "PhotoKit" and select it.
7. Make sure the PhotoKit framework is added to your project.

## Applying filters to photos

PhotoKit provides a wide range of filters that can be applied to photos. These filters allow you to adjust the colors, tones, and other properties of an image to achieve different visual effects.

To apply a filter to a photo using PhotoKit, follow these steps:

1. Import the PhotoKit framework in your code:
```swift
import Photos
```

2. Fetch the desired photo asset using its local identifier:
```swift
let fetchResult = PHAsset.fetchAssets(withLocalIdentifiers: [photoLocalIdentifier], options: nil)
guard let asset = fetchResult.firstObject else { return }
```

3. Create a `PHContentEditingInputRequestOptions` object to specify the options for editing the photo:
```swift
let requestOptions = PHContentEditingInputRequestOptions()
requestOptions.canHandleAdjustmentData = { (adjustmentData: PHAdjustmentData) -> Bool in
    return true
}
```

4. Get the content editing input for the photo asset:
```swift
asset.requestContentEditingInput(with: requestOptions) { (contentEditingInput, _) in
    guard let input = contentEditingInput else { return }
    guard let imageURL = input.fullSizeImageURL else { return }

    // Apply the desired filter to the photo
    let filteredImage = // Apply the desired filter using the imageURL

    // Display the filtered image
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        imageView.image = filteredImage
    }
}
```

Note: The actual implementation of applying the filter will depend on the filter you want to use. PhotoKit provides various methods to apply different types of filters.

And voila! You have successfully applied a filter to a photo using PhotoKit.

## Applying effects to photos

In addition to filters, PhotoKit allows you to apply various effects to your photos. Effects are different from filters as they add artistic elements or modify the overall appearance of the photo.

To apply an effect to a photo using PhotoKit, follow these steps:

1. Import the PhotoKit framework in your code (if not already imported):
```swift
import Photos
```

2. Fetch the desired photo asset using its local identifier (same as in applying filters):
```swift
let fetchResult = PHAsset.fetchAssets(withLocalIdentifiers: [photoLocalIdentifier], options: nil)
guard let asset = fetchResult.firstObject else { return }
```

3. Create a `PHContentEditingInputRequestOptions` object (same as in applying filters).

4. Get the content editing input for the photo asset (same as in applying filters).

5. Apply the desired effect to the photo:
```swift
let output = // Apply the desired effect using the filteredImage obtained in the previous step

// Display the photo with applied effect
DispatchQueue.main.async {
    imageView.image = output
}
```

Similar to applying filters, the actual implementation of applying effects will depend on the effect you want to use. PhotoKit provides methods to apply effects like adding a vignette, applying a tilt-shift effect, and more.

## Conclusion

With PhotoKit, you can easily enhance your photos by applying filters and effects programmatically. This gives you the freedom to create stunning visuals and unleash your creativity.

In this blog post, we explored how to apply filters and effects to photos using Apple's PhotoKit framework. We covered the basics of adding the framework to your project and demonstrated the steps to apply filters and effects to photos.

So go ahead, experiment with different filters and effects, and make your photos truly stand out!
