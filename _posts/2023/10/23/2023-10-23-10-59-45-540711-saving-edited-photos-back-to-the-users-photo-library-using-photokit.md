## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>
PhotoKit is a powerful framework provided by Apple to manage and edit photos on iOS devices. It allows developers to access the user's photo library, retrieve and modify photos, and perform various editing operations.

When working with PhotoKit, developers often need to provide users with the ability to edit photos and save those edited versions back to the photo library. In this blog post, we will focus on the process of saving edited photos using PhotoKit.

## Editing Photos using PhotoKit<a name="editing-photos-using-photokit"></a>
Before we can save edited photos, we first need to understand how to edit photos using PhotoKit. PhotoKit provides various editing options, such as adjusting brightness, cropping, applying filters, and more.

To edit a photo using PhotoKit, developers can follow these steps:

1. Retrieve the PHAsset object representing the photo from the photo library.
2. Create an instance of `PHContentEditingInputRequestOptions` and set the `canHandleAdjustmentData` property to `true`.
3. Use the `requestContentEditingInput(with:options:completionHandler:)` method of `PHAsset` to retrieve the editing input for the photo.
4. Process the editing input and apply desired edits using Core Image, Core Graphics, or any other image processing framework.
5. Create an instance of `PHAdjustmentData` and set it with relevant information about the edits performed.
6. Create an instance of `PHContentEditingOutput` using the edited image data and the adjustment data.
7. Use the `PHAssetChangeRequest` class to save the edited photo using `PHContentEditingOutput`.

## Saving Edited Photos<a name="saving-edited-photos"></a>
Once the photo has been edited using the steps mentioned above, we can save the edited version back to the user's photo library using the `PHAssetChangeRequest` class.

Here's an example code snippet to save the edited photo:

```swift
func saveEditedPhoto(photo: PHAsset, editingOutput: PHContentEditingOutput) {
    PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges({
        let request = PHAssetChangeRequest(for: photo)
        request.contentEditingOutput = editingOutput
    }, completionHandler: { success, error in
        if success {
            print("Edited photo saved successfully!")
        } else if let error = error {
            print("Error saving edited photo: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    })
}
```

In the above code snippet, we use the `performChanges(_:completionHandler:)` method of `PHPhotoLibrary` to save the changes made to the photo. The `PHAssetChangeRequest` object is used to set the `contentEditingOutput` property with the `PHContentEditingOutput` instance.

## Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>
PhotoKit provides a comprehensive set of tools to manage and edit photos on iOS devices. By following the steps mentioned in this blog post, developers can easily save edited photos back to the user's photo library using PhotoKit.

Remember to handle permissions and request access to the user's photo library before performing any operations using PhotoKit.
