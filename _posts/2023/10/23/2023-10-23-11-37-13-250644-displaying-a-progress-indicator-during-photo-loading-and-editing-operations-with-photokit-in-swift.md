PhotoKit is a powerful framework provided by Apple that allows developers to manage and work with photos and videos on iOS devices. When performing time-consuming operations, such as loading or editing photos, it is important to provide visual feedback to the user to indicate the progress of the task. In this tutorial, we will explore how to display a progress indicator during photo loading and editing operations using PhotoKit in Swift.

## Introduction to PhotoKit

PhotoKit provides a set of high-level APIs to access and manage photos and videos on iOS devices. It allows developers to fetch and modify assets in the user's photo library with ease. 

## Displaying a Progress Indicator

Before we dive into loading and editing photos, let's first set up a progress indicator. We can use the `UIProgressView` class provided by UIKit to visually represent the progress of a task. 

To create a progress view, add the following code to your view controller:

```swift
let progressView = UIProgressView(progressViewStyle: .default)
progressView.center = view.center
view.addSubview(progressView)
```

This will create a progress view and add it to the center of the view controller's view. You can customize the appearance of the progress view according to your application's design requirements.

## Loading a Photo with Progress Indicator

To load a photo using PhotoKit with a progress indicator, we need to use the `PHAsset` class to represent the photo asset. We can then use the `PHImageManager` class to request the image data for the asset, while keeping track of the progress using a `PHImageRequestOptions` object.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates loading a photo with a progress indicator:

```swift
import Photos

let asset = PHAsset() // Replace with your actual asset

let options = PHImageRequestOptions()
options.isNetworkAccessAllowed = true
options.progressHandler = { (progress, error, stop, info) in
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        progressView.progress = Float(progress)
    }
}

PHImageManager.default().requestImageData(for: asset, options: options) { (data, _, _, _) in
    // Process the loaded image data
}
```

In the above code, we create a `PHImageRequestOptions` object and set its `isNetworkAccessAllowed` property to `true`, which allows the system to fetch the image from the network if necessary. We then set the `progressHandler` property of the options object to update the progress view. Finally, we use the `requestImageData` method of `PHImageManager` to fetch the image data for the specified asset.

## Editing a Photo with Progress Indicator

When editing a photo using PhotoKit, the `PHContentEditingInput` class provides an interface to access the original photo data and metadata. We can use this class along with the `PHContentEditingOutput` class to perform editing operations such as applying filters or cropping the photo.

To edit a photo with a progress indicator, we can follow a similar approach as the photo loading example. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates editing a photo with a progress indicator:

```swift
import Photos

let input = PHContentEditingInput() // Replace with your actual input

let options = PHContentEditingOutputRequestOptions()
options.progressHandler = { (progress, error, stop, info) in
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        progressView.progress = Float(progress)
    }
}

PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges({
    // Perform the editing operations
    
}, completionHandler: { success, error in
    // Handle completion
})
```

In the above code, we create a `PHContentEditingOutputRequestOptions` object and set its `progressHandler` property to update the progress view. We then use `PHPhotoLibrary`'s `performChanges` method to perform the editing operations within a change block. Finally, in the completion handler, we handle the success or error of the editing operation.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to display a progress indicator during photo loading and editing operations using PhotoKit in Swift. By providing visual feedback to the user, we can improve the user experience and indicate the progress of time-consuming tasks. PhotoKit offers powerful APIs to interact with photos and videos, opening up various possibilities for building rich media applications on iOS devices.
