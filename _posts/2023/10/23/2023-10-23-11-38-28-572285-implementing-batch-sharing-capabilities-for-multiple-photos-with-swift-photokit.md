Sharing multiple photos in an app can be a challenging task, especially when it comes to selecting and sharing them in batches. Luckily, Apple's PhotoKit framework in Swift provides us with powerful tools to implement batch sharing capabilities seamlessly. In this blog post, we'll explore how to leverage PhotoKit to build a photo-sharing feature in your iOS app.

## Introduction to PhotoKit

PhotoKit is a framework provided by Apple that enables developers to work with and manipulate the photo library on iOS devices. It provides a high-level API to perform various operations, such as fetching photos, creating albums, and editing metadata.

## Requesting User Authorization

Before accessing the user's photo library, it's crucial to request user authorization. Without proper authorization, your app won't be able to access or manipulate the user's photos. To request authorization, you can use the `PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization()` method. Here's an example of how to request authorization:

```swift
import Photos

PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization { status in
    switch status {
    case .authorized:
        // User has granted access to the photo library
        // Proceed with photo selection and sharing
    case .denied, .restricted:
        // Display an alert or prompt the user to grant access to the photo library
    case .notDetermined:
        // Authorization status not determined yet, handle accordingly
    @unknown default:
        break
    }
}
```

## Selecting Multiple Photos

To enable selecting multiple photos, we can utilize the `PHImageManager` and `PHAsset` classes provided by PhotoKit. We can fetch the `PHAsset` objects representing the selected photos and add them to an array for further processing.

Here's an example of how to fetch multiple photos and store their `PHAsset` objects:

```swift
import Photos

func fetchSelectedPhotos(completion: @escaping ([PHAsset]) -> Void) {
    let options = PHFetchOptions()
    options.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "mediaType = %d", PHAssetMediaType.image.rawValue)
    
    let fetchResult = PHAsset.fetchAssets(with: options)
    var selectedPhotos: [PHAsset] = []
    
    fetchResult.enumerateObjects { asset, _, _ in
        selectedPhotos.append(asset)
    }
    
    completion(selectedPhotos)
}
```

## Creating a Sharing UI

To provide a user-friendly experience, we need to create a sharing UI where users can select multiple photos and initiate the sharing process. You can create a custom UI using collection views, table views, or even SwiftUI.

Once the user selects the desired photos, pass the selected `PHAsset` objects to the sharing process.

## Sharing Multiple Photos

To share multiple photos, we can utilize the `UIActivityViewController` class provided by UIKit. The `UIActivityViewController` allows users to share content through various services like Messages, Mail, and more.

Here's an example of how to share multiple photos using the `UIActivityViewController`:

```swift
import UIKit
import Photos

func sharePhotos(_ assets: [PHAsset], from viewController: UIViewController) {
    var images: [UIImage] = []
    
    let imageManager = PHImageManager.default()
    let options = PHImageRequestOptions()
    options.isSynchronous = true
    
    for asset in assets {
        imageManager.requestImage(for: asset, targetSize: CGSize(width: 300, height: 300), contentMode: .aspectFill, options: options) { image, _ in
            if let image = image {
                images.append(image)
            }
        }
    }
    
    let activityViewController = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: images, applicationActivities: nil)
    viewController.present(activityViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

## Conclusion

Implementing batch sharing capabilities for multiple photos in your iOS app using PhotoKit is a powerful way to enhance the user experience. By leveraging the features provided by PhotoKit, you can seamlessly integrate photo selection and sharing functionalities. Remember to handle user authorization, create a user-friendly sharing UI, and utilize the `UIActivityViewController` for sharing multiple photos. Happy coding!
