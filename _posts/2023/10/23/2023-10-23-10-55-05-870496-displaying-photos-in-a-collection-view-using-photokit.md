In this tutorial, we will explore how to use PhotoKit to display photos in a collection view in an iOS app. PhotoKit is a powerful framework provided by Apple that allows developers to work with photos and videos in a user's photo library.

### Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of iOS app development and have Xcode installed on your machine.

### Step 1: Setting up the Project

Start by creating a new iOS project in Xcode. Choose the "Single View App" template and give your project a name. Make sure to select Swift as the programming language.

### Step 2: Importing the PhotoKit Framework

First, we need to import the PhotoKit framework into our project. Open the project navigator in Xcode, select your project, and navigate to the "Build Phases" tab. Expand the "Link Binary With Libraries" section, click the "+" button, and search for "Photos.framework". Select it and click "Add".

### Step 3: Requesting Photo Library Access

To access the user's photo library, we need to request permission from the user. In your view controller, add the following code to request authorization:

```swift
import Photos

PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization { status in
    switch status {
    case .authorized:
        // User granted access, continue with the app logic
    case .denied, .restricted:
        // The user denied access or the device has restricted access, show an error message
    case .notDetermined:
        // The user has not yet made a choice, handle accordingly
    @unknown default:
        fatalError("Unhandled authorization status")
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Fetching Photos

Next, let's fetch the photos from the user's photo library. Add the following function to your view controller:

```swift
func fetchPhotos() {
    let fetchOptions = PHFetchOptions()
    fetchOptions.sortDescriptors = [NSSortDescriptor(key: "creationDate", ascending: false)]
    
    let fetchResult = PHAsset.fetchAssets(with: .image, options: fetchOptions)
    
    // Process the fetchResult and store the fetched photos in an array
    var photos: [UIImage] = []
    fetchResult.enumerateObjects { asset, _, _ in
        let imageManager = PHImageManager.default()
        let targetSize = CGSize(width: 200, height: 200)
        
        let options = PHImageRequestOptions()
        options.deliveryMode = .highQualityFormat
        options.resizeMode = .exact
        
        imageManager.requestImage(for: asset, targetSize: targetSize, contentMode: .aspectFill, options: options) { image, _ in
            if let image = image {
                photos.append(image)
            }
            
            // Reload the collection view once all photos have been fetched
            if photos.count == fetchResult.count {
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    self.collectionView.reloadData()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Implementing the Collection View

In your view controller, add a `UICollectionView` to your storyboard and create an outlet for it in your view controller class. Then, implement the necessary collection view data source methods:

```swift
extension ViewController: UICollectionViewDataSource {
    func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, numberOfItemsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
        return photos.count
    }
    
    func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UICollectionViewCell {
        let cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCell(withReuseIdentifier: "PhotoCell", for: indexPath) as! PhotoCell
        cell.imageView.image = photos[indexPath.item]
        return cell
    }
}
```

Don't forget to set the data source of your collection view in `viewDidLoad()`:

```swift
collectionView.dataSource = self
```

### Step 6: Displaying the Collection View

Finally, call the `fetchPhotos()` method in `viewDidLoad()` to fetch the user's photos and populate the collection view:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    fetchPhotos()
}
```

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to use PhotoKit to display photos in a collection view in an iOS app. We started by setting up the project and importing the PhotoKit framework. Then, we requested access to the user's photo library and fetched the photos. Finally, we implemented the collection view and populated it with the fetched photos.

With PhotoKit, developers have a powerful tool at their disposal to work with photos and videos in their iOS apps. Explore the PhotoKit documentation for more advanced features and functionalities.
