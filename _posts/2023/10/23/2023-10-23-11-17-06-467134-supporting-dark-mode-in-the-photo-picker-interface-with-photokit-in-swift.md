## Enabling Dark Mode in the App

To enable Dark Mode in your app, make sure you have support for it by following these steps:

1. Open your Xcode project.
2. Navigate to the asset catalog.
3. Create a new set of assets specifically for Dark Mode by selecting the "+" button and choosing "New Color Set".
4. Set the desired dark color for each asset.

Once you have set up Dark Mode assets, Xcode will automatically use the appropriate color for the current appearance of the app.

## Adjusting the Photo Picker Interface

To adjust the Photo Picker interface to support Dark Mode, we will use the PhotoKit framework to present the picker. Here's an example of how you can set up the photo picker in your app:

```swift
import UIKit
import PhotosUI

class ViewController: UIViewController, PHPickerViewControllerDelegate {
    
    func showPhotoPicker() {
        var configuration = PHPickerConfiguration()
        configuration.selectionLimit = 1
        
        let picker = PHPickerViewController(configuration: configuration)
        picker.delegate = self
        present(picker, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
    
    func picker(_ picker: PHPickerViewController, didFinishPicking results: [PHPickerResult]) {
        // Handle selected photos
    }
    
}

```

## Updating Appearance for Dark Mode

To update the appearance of the Photo Picker interface for Dark Mode, you can utilize the `overrideUserInterfaceStyle` property of the `UIViewController` to set it explicitly to `.dark`, like this:

```swift
picker.overrideUserInterfaceStyle = .dark
```

This will ensure that the Photo Picker interface appears in Dark Mode regardless of the app's appearance.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to support Dark Mode in the Photo Picker interface using PhotoKit in Swift. By following these steps, you can ensure that your app provides a seamless and visually appealing experience for users on iOS devices. Embracing Dark Mode not only enhances the aesthetics of your app but also improves usability in low-light environments.
