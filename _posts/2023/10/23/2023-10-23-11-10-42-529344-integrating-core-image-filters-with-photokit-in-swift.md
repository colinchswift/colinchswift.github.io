In iOS development, working with images often involves applying filters to enhance or modify them. Apple's Core Image framework provides a wide range of pre-built filters that can be applied to images. Additionally, the PhotoKit framework allows us to access the device's photo library and perform various operations on the images.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to integrate Core Image filters with PhotoKit in Swift. We will build a simple app that allows users to select an image from their photo library and apply a filter to it.

## Setting up the project

To begin, create a new Xcode project and select the "Single View App" template. Make sure to choose Swift as the programming language.

## Accessing the photo library

First, we need to request user authorization to access the photo library. This can be done by adding the following code to your view controller's `viewDidLoad()` method:

```swift
import Photos

PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization { status in
    if status == .authorized {
        // Access to the photo library granted
    } else {
        // Access to the photo library denied
    }
}
```

Once authorization is granted, we can use the `PHPhotoLibrary.shared()` instance to interact with the photo library.

## Displaying selected image

To allow the user to select an image from their library, we can use the `UIImagePickerController` class. Add the following code to your view controller:

```swift
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController, UIImagePickerControllerDelegate, UINavigationControllerDelegate {

    @IBAction func selectImagePressed() {
        let imagePicker = UIImagePickerController()
        imagePicker.delegate = self
        imagePicker.sourceType = .photoLibrary
        present(imagePicker, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }

    // UIImagePickerControllerDelegate method
    func imagePickerController(_ picker: UIImagePickerController, didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo info: [UIImagePickerController.InfoKey : Any]) {
        dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)

        if let image = info[UIImagePickerController.InfoKey.originalImage] as? UIImage {
            // Display the selected image
        }
    }
}
```

In this code, we present the `UIImagePickerController` as a modal view controller, allowing the user to select an image from their photo library. After the user selects an image, the `imagePickerController(_:didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:)` method is called, where we can access the selected image.

## Applying Core Image filters

To apply a Core Image filter to an image, we first need to create a `CIImage` object from the selected `UIImage`. We can then create an instance of the desired filter and apply it to the image.

```swift
import CoreImage

if let ciImage = CIImage(image: image) {
    let filter = CIFilter(name: "CIPhotoEffectNoir")
    filter?.setValue(ciImage, forKey: kCIInputImageKey)

    if let outputImage = filter?.outputImage {
        let context = CIContext(options: nil)
        if let cgImage = context.createCGImage(outputImage, from: outputImage.extent) {
            let filteredImage = UIImage(cgImage: cgImage)
            // Display the filtered image
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we use the "CIPhotoEffectNoir" filter to convert the image to black and white. The resulting filtered image can then be displayed to the user.

## Implementing filter selection

To give users the ability to select different filters, we can present a list of available filters and apply the selected filter to the image.

```swift
let alertController = UIAlertController(title: "Select a filter", message: nil, preferredStyle: .actionSheet)

let filters = ["Original", "Chrome", "Fade", "Instant", "Mono", "Noir", "Process", "Tonal"]
for filterName in filters {
    let filterAction = UIAlertAction(title: filterName, style: .default) { [weak self] _ in
        self?.applyFilter(filterName, to: image)
    }
    alertController.addAction(filterAction)
}

alertController.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Cancel", style: .cancel, handler: nil))

present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

In this code, we create an alert controller with a list of available filters. When a filter is selected, the `applyFilter(_:to:)` method is called to apply the selected filter to the image and display the filtered image.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to integrate Core Image filters with PhotoKit in Swift. We have seen how to access the photo library, display selected images, apply filters, and implement filter selection.

With this knowledge, you can build more sophisticated image editing apps or add photo effects to enhance your user's experience. Happy coding!
