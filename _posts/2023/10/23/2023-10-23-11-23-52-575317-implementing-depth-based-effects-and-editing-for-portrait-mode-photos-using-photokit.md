With the advancements in smartphone camera technology, users now have the ability to capture stunning photos with depth-of-field effects, commonly known as portrait mode. These effects enable the main subject of the photo to stand out by blurring the background. If you're a developer looking to incorporate depth-based effects and editing for portrait mode photos into your app, PhotoKit is here to help.

PhotoKit is a framework provided by Apple that allows developers to work with the user's photo library and implement various photo editing capabilities. In this blog post, we will explore how to leverage PhotoKit to apply depth-based effects and editing to portrait mode photos.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need the following:
- Xcode 12 or later
- An iOS device with a dual-camera setup (portrait mode capability)
- Basic knowledge of Swift programming language

## Step 1: Accessing Portrait Mode Photos using PhotoKit
To get started, we need to access the portrait mode photos from the user's photo library. PhotoKit provides a powerful API to fetch assets from the user's library, including the ability to query specifically for portrait mode photos. Here's an example of how to fetch all portrait mode photos:

```swift
import Photos

let fetchOptions = PHFetchOptions()
fetchOptions.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "mediaSubtype == %ld", PHAssetMediaSubtype.photoDepthEffect.rawValue)
let fetchResult = PHAsset.fetchAssets(with: fetchOptions)
```

In this code snippet, we define a `fetchOptions` object to specify that we only want assets with the `PHAssetMediaSubtype.photoDepthEffect` media subtype, which corresponds to portrait mode photos. Then, we use `PHAsset.fetchAssets(with:options:)` to query the user's library and fetch all the matching assets.

## Step 2: Applying Depth-based Effects
Once we have the portrait mode photos, we can proceed to apply depth-based effects. PhotoKit provides a depth API that allows us to access the depth data embedded in the portrait mode photos. We can then use this data to generate various effects, such as applying depth-of-field blur.

```swift
let photoAsset = fetchResult.firstObject
let options = PHContentEditingInputRequestOptions()

photoAsset?.requestContentEditingInput(with: options, completionHandler: { (contentEditingInput, _) in
    guard let input = contentEditingInput else { return }
    
    let imageFileURL = input.fullSizeImageURL
    let ciImage = CIImage(contentsOf: imageFileURL)
    
    // Apply depth-based effects using CIImage and Core Image filters
})
```

In this code snippet, we retrieve the first portrait mode photo asset from the fetch result. Then, we request the content editing input using `requestContentEditingInput(with:completionHandler:)` to obtain the full-size photo and its associated depth data. We can use the full-size image URL to create a `CIImage` and start applying depth-based effects using Core Image filters.

## Step 3: Editing Portrait Mode Photos
Apart from applying depth-based effects, we can also allow users to edit other aspects of the portrait mode photo using PhotoKit. This includes adjusting exposure, contrast, saturation, and more.

```swift
let adjustmentData = PHAdjustmentData(formatIdentifier: "com.example.app.adjustment", formatVersion: "1.0", data: <adjustmentData>)
input.adjustmentData = adjustmentData
```

Here, we can create an instance of `PHAdjustmentData` to store any adjustments made to the photo. The `adjustmentData` property of `PHContentEditingInput` can be used to store this information.

## Conclusion
PhotoKit provides powerful tools to access and edit portrait mode photos in your iOS app. By leveraging the depth API and editing capabilities, you can enhance the user experience and offer advanced features to your users. Remember to handle any errors and request appropriate permissions from the user before accessing their photo library.

In this blog post, we covered the basics of implementing depth-based effects and editing for portrait mode photos using PhotoKit. We hope this serves as a starting point for your photo editing app development journey.
