When working with photos in an application, it is important to provide users with the ability to make edits without losing their original photos. This can be achieved by implementing non-destructive edits and reversible changes using Apple's PhotoKit framework. In this blog post, we will explore how to support these features in your photo editing app.

## Introduction

When users edit their photos, it is crucial to preserve the original image so that they can revert back to it if needed. With non-destructive edits, the app applies changes on top of the original photo instead of modifying the original data. Reversible changes take it one step further by allowing users to undo or redo multiple edits in a sequential manner. Both of these features improve the user experience and give them more control over the editing process.

## Understanding Non-Destructive Edits

Non-destructive edits in PhotoKit involve creating an editing session where changes are applied to a copy of the original image. This means that the original photo remains untouched while the edits are stored separately. Each edit represents a modification, such as adjusting brightness, contrast, or cropping the image. By saving these edits as a separate layer, the app can display the modified version while still preserving the original data.

## Implementing Non-Destructive Edits with PhotoKit

To implement non-destructive edits in your app using PhotoKit, you need to follow these steps:

1. Retrieve the original photo using the `PHAsset` class.
2. Create an editing session with `PHContentEditingInputRequestOptions`.
3. Apply edits to the photo using `PHContentEditingOutput`.
4. Save the edited photo with `PHPhotoLibrary`.

By following this approach, you create a separate edited version of the photo without modifying the original data. You can then display this edited version to the user while always having the option to revert back to the original photo.

## Reversible Changes with PhotoKit

To enable reversible changes, you can leverage the power of the `PHUndoManager` class provided by PhotoKit. This class allows users to undo or redo edits in the order they were applied. It keeps track of each edit and provides methods to handle undo and redo functionality seamlessly.

By integrating `PHUndoManager` into your app, users can have complete control over their editing history, enabling them to revert back to any previous state of the photo. You can also provide an intuitive interface, such as a slider or a timeline view, to visualize the editing history and allow users to jump to specific points in their changes.

## Conclusion

Supporting non-destructive edits and reversible changes in your photo editing app using PhotoKit enhances the user experience and empowers users to edit their photos confidently. By implementing these features, you can give users the freedom to experiment with different edits and easily revert back to their original photos if desired. PhotoKit provides the necessary tools and classes to support these functionalities and make your app stand out in the crowded photo editing market.

Remember to use non-destructive edits and reversible changes when working with photos in your applications! #PhotoKit #NonDestructiveEdits
