PhotoKit is a powerful framework in iOS that allows developers to work with photos and videos in a seamless manner. With PhotoKit, you can easily access the user's photo library, organize and create custom photo albums and collections. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to create custom photo albums and collections using PhotoKit in Swift.

## Introduction to PhotoKit

PhotoKit provides a set of classes and methods that enable you to access and manage photos and videos on iOS devices. It offers powerful features like fetching assets, organizing them into albums and collections, and performing various operations like adding, deleting, and editing photos.

To start using PhotoKit in your app, you need to import the framework and request user authorization to access their photo library.

```swift
import Photos

PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization { status in
    if status == .authorized {
        // Access to photo library granted
    } else {
        // Access to photo library denied
    }
}
```

## Creating a Custom Photo Album

To create a custom photo album, you first need to fetch the user's photo library and create a new album with a specific title. Here's an example of how to create a custom photo album named "My Album":

```swift
func createAlbum() {
    PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges({
        let createAlbumRequest = PHAssetCollectionChangeRequest.creationRequestForAssetCollection(withTitle: "My Album")
        if let assetCollectionPlaceholder = createAlbumRequest.placeholderForCreatedAssetCollection {
            // Save the album identifier for later use
            let albumIdentifier = assetCollectionPlaceholder.localIdentifier
        }
    }, completionHandler: { success, error in
        if success {
            // Album created successfully
        } else {
            // Error occurred while creating the album
        }
    })
}
```

## Adding Photos to a Custom Album

Once you have created a custom album, you can add photos to it. To add a photo, you need to retrieve the photo's `PHAsset` object and then add it to the album using `PHAssetCollectionChangeRequest`:

```swift
func addPhotoToAlbum(photo: UIImage, albumIdentifier: String) {
    PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges({
        let createAssetRequest = PHAssetChangeRequest.creationRequestForAsset(from: photo)
        if let assetPlaceholder = createAssetRequest.placeholderForCreatedAsset {
            // Fetch the album using its identifier
            let albumFetchResult = PHAssetCollection.fetchAssetCollections(withLocalIdentifiers: [albumIdentifier], options: nil)
            if let album = albumFetchResult.firstObject {
                // Add the photo to the album
                let albumChangeRequest = PHAssetCollectionChangeRequest(for: album)
                albumChangeRequest?.addAssets([assetPlaceholder] as NSFastEnumeration)
            }
        }
    }, completionHandler: { success, error in
        if success {
            // Photo added successfully
        } else {
            // Error occurred while adding the photo
        }
    })
}
```

## Creating a Photo Collection

In addition to albums, PhotoKit also allows you to create photo collections. A photo collection is a group of related photos, typically organized based on a specific criteria. Here's an example of creating a photo collection named "My Collection" and adding photos to it:

```swift
func createPhotoCollection() {
    PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges({
        let createCollectionRequest = PHCollectionListChangeRequest.creationRequestForAssetCollection(withTitle: "My Collection")
        if let collectionPlaceholder = createCollectionRequest.placeholderForCreatedAssetCollection {
            // Save the collection identifier for later use
            let collectionIdentifier = collectionPlaceholder.localIdentifier
            // Fetch photos based on a specific criteria
            let fetchOptions = PHFetchOptions()
            fetchOptions.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "...")
            let photoFetchResult = PHAsset.fetchAssets(with: fetchOptions)
            // Add the fetched photos to the collection
            let collectionChangeRequest = PHCollectionListChangeRequest(for: collectionPlaceholder as! PHObjectPlaceholder)
            collectionChangeRequest?.addAssets(photoFetchResult as! PHFetchResult<PHObject>)
        }
    }, completionHandler: { success, error in
        if success {
            // Photo collection created successfully
        } else {
            // Error occurred while creating the collection
        }
    })
}
```
