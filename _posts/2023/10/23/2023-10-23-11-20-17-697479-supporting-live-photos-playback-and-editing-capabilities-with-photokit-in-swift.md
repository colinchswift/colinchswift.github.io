Live Photos introduced in iOS 9 allows users to capture both the still photo and a short video clip before and after the photo was taken. With the PhotoKit framework in Swift, we can easily access and manipulate the Live Photos in our apps.

In this blog post, we will explore how to support Live Photos playback and editing capabilities using the PhotoKit framework in Swift.

## Introduction to Live Photos
Live Photos capture a 3-second video clip with audio before and after the photo was taken. When the user interacts with a Live Photo, they can see the photo come to life and hear the recorded audio. It provides a more immersive experience compared to traditional static photos.

## Accessing Live Photos with PhotoKit
PhotoKit is the framework provided by Apple for managing and manipulating photos and videos in iOS. To access Live Photos, we need to use the `PHAsset` class, which represents an image or a video asset in the Photos library.

We can use the `PHAsset` class to query for Live Photos in the user's photo library and display them in our app.

```swift
// Querying for Live Photos
let options = PHFetchOptions()
options.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "mediaSubtype == %ld", PHAssetMediaSubtype.photoLive.rawValue)
let livePhotos = PHAsset.fetchAssets(with: options)
```

## Playing Live Photos
To play a Live Photo, we can use the `PHLivePhotoView` class, which is a subclass of `UIView` specifically designed to display Live Photos.

Here's an example of how we can display a Live Photo in our app:

```swift
let livePhotoView = PHLivePhotoView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 300))
livePhotoView.livePhoto = livePhoto // `livePhoto` is an instance of `PHLivePhoto`
livePhotoView.startPlayback(with: .full)
```

## Editing Live Photos
PhotoKit also provides capabilities to edit Live Photos within our app. We can use the `PHContentEditingInputRequestOptions` class to request an editable copy of the Live Photo. This allows the user to apply filters, crop, or make other modifications to the Live Photo.

```swift
let editOptions = PHContentEditingInputRequestOptions()
editOptions.canHandleAdjustmentData = { adjustmentData in
    // Check if the desired adjustment data can be applied to the Live Photo
    return true
}

// Request an editable copy of the Live Photo
livePhoto.requestContentEditingInput(with: editOptions) { (input, _) in
    guard let input = input else { return }
    
    // Retrieve the Live Photo content editing output
    let contentEditingOutput = PHContentEditingOutput(contentEditingInput: input)
    
    // Perform the desired edits on the Live Photo
    // ...
    
    // Save the edited Live Photo
    PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges({
        let request = PHAssetChangeRequest(for: self.livePhoto)
        request.contentEditingOutput = contentEditingOutput
    }) { (success, error) in
        if success {
            // Live Photo successfully edited and saved
        } else {
            // Error occurred while saving the edited Live Photo
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
With the PhotoKit framework and Swift, we can easily add support for Live Photos playback and editing in our apps. By leveraging the `PHAsset` class and the various classes provided by PhotoKit, we can access, display, and manipulate Live Photos to provide an enhanced visual experience for our users.

So go ahead and incorporate Live Photos into your apps, and let your users enjoy the dynamic moments captured by Live Photos!
