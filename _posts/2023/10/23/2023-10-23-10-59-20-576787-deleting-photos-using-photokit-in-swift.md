With the advancements in digital photography and the increasing number of photos we capture, managing and organizing our photo library has become more important than ever. In iOS development, PhotoKit framework provides a powerful toolset to access and manipulate the user's photo and video library. In this blog post, we will explore how to delete photos using PhotoKit in Swift.

## Introduction to PhotoKit

PhotoKit framework was introduced in iOS 8 and it allows developers to work with the user's photo library and iCloud Photo Library seamlessly. It provides a high-level API to fetch, edit, and delete photos and videos, as well as perform advanced search and content analysis.

## Deleting Photos

To delete a photo using PhotoKit, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Request for authorization to access the photo library using the `PHPhotoLibrary` class.
2. Fetch the desired photo using `PHAsset.fetchAssets(with:)` method.
3. Delete the photo using `PHAssetChangeRequest.deleteAssets(_:)` method within a `PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges(_:)` block.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to delete a photo using PhotoKit:

```swift
import Photos

func deletePhoto(with localIdentifier: String) {
    PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization { status in
        if status == .authorized {
            let fetchOptions = PHFetchOptions()
            fetchOptions.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "localIdentifier = %@", localIdentifier)

            let fetchResult = PHAsset.fetchAssets(with: fetchOptions)

            if let asset = fetchResult.firstObject {
                PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges({
                    PHAssetChangeRequest.deleteAssets([asset] as NSArray)
                }, completionHandler: { success, error in
                    if success {
                        print("Photo deleted successfully.")
                    } else {
                        print("Failed to delete photo: ", error?.localizedDescription ?? "")
                    }
                })
            } else {
                print("No photo found with specified identifier.")
            }
        } else {
            print("Access to photo library denied.")
        }
    }
}
```

In the above code, `deletePhoto(with:)` function takes a parameter `localIdentifier` which is the identifier of the photo to be deleted. It requests the user's authorization, fetches the photo using the identifier, and finally deletes it using the `deleteAssets(_:)` method within the `performChanges(_:)` block.

## Handling Authorization

Before you can delete photos using PhotoKit, your app must have the required user authorization. To ensure authorization is granted, it is important to handle the authorization status properly. In the code snippet above, we check if the authorization status is `.authorized`, which means the user has granted access to the photo library. If the status is not authorized, you can request authorization using `PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization(_:)` method.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to delete photos using PhotoKit in Swift. We learned the necessary steps to request authorization, fetch the desired photo, and delete it using the appropriate methods provided by PhotoKit framework. Using PhotoKit, developers can build powerful photo management features in their iOS apps. PhotoKit not only makes it easier to perform operations on the user's photo library but also ensures seamless integration with iCloud Photo Library.
