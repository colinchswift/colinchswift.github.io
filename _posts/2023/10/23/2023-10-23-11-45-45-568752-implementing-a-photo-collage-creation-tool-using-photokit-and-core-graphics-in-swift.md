Photo collages have become a popular way to showcase multiple photos in a single layout. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a simple photo collage creation tool using PhotoKit and Core Graphics in Swift.

## Introduction
PhotoKit is a powerful framework provided by Apple for working with photos and videos on iOS devices. Core Graphics, on the other hand, is a framework that allows us to perform drawing and image manipulation. By combining these two frameworks, we can create a photo collage creation tool that fetches photos from the user's library and arranges them in a customizable layout.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you will need:
- Xcode 12 or above
- Basic knowledge of Swift programming language
- Familiarity with PhotoKit and Core Graphics frameworks

## Setting Up the Project
1. Open Xcode and create a new Swift project.
2. Set the project name and other necessary details.
3. Import the PhotoKit and Core Graphics frameworks into your project by adding the following import statements at the top of your ViewController file:
```swift
import PhotoKit
import CoreGraphics
```

## Fetching Photos using PhotoKit
In order to create a photo collage, we first need to fetch the photos from the user's photo library. We can do this using the `PHAsset` and `PHImageManager` classes provided by PhotoKit.

```swift
// Fetch photos from the user's library
func fetchPhotos() {
    let fetchOptions = PHFetchOptions()
    fetchOptions.sortDescriptors = [NSSortDescriptor(key: "creationDate", ascending: false)]
    let fetchResult = PHAsset.fetchAssets(with: .image, options: fetchOptions)
    
    // Process the fetched photos
    fetchResult.enumerateObjects { (asset, index, _) in
        let requestOptions = PHImageRequestOptions()
        requestOptions.deliveryMode = .highQualityFormat
        requestOptions.isSynchronous = true
        
        PHImageManager.default().requestImage(for: asset,
                                              targetSize: CGSize(width: 200, height: 200),
                                              contentMode: .aspectFit,
                                              options: requestOptions) { (image, _) in
            // Do something with the fetched image
        }
    }
}
```

## Creating a Collage Layout
Next, we need to define a layout for our photo collage. For simplicity, let's create a fixed layout with three equally-sized image placeholders.

```swift
struct CollageLayout {
    let numberOfColumns: Int
    let numberOfRows: Int
}

let collageLayout = CollageLayout(numberOfColumns: 3, numberOfRows: 3)
```

## Placing Photos on the Collage
We can use Core Graphics to draw the photo collage by placing the fetched photos on the layout. We will define a method that takes an image and a target frame, and then draws the image on the frame using Core Graphics.

```swift
func drawImage(_ image: UIImage, in frame: CGRect) {
    guard let context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext() else { return }
    context.saveGState()
    
    let cgImage = image.cgImage
    context.translateBy(x: frame.origin.x, y: frame.origin.y)
    context.scaleBy(x: 1, y: -1)
    context.draw(cgImage!, in: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: frame.width, height: frame.height))
    
    context.restoreGState()
}

// Usage:
let image = UIImage(named: "exampleImage.jpg")
let frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 200, height: 200)
drawImage(image, in: frame)
```

## Exporting and Sharing the Collage
Once the photo collage is created, we can export it as an image and provide options for sharing. We can use the `UIGraphicsImageRenderer` class to render the collage as an image.

```swift
func exportCollage() -> UIImage? {
    let renderer = UIGraphicsImageRenderer(size: CGSize(width: collageWidth, height: collageHeight))
    
    let image = renderer.image { _ in
        // Draw the photo collage using Core Graphics
        // ...
    }
    
    return image
}

func shareCollage() {
    guard let collageImage = exportCollage() else { return }
    
    let activityViewController = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: [collageImage], applicationActivities: nil)
    present(activityViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have learned how to create a simple photo collage creation tool using PhotoKit and Core Graphics in Swift. We fetched photos from the user's library, created a collage layout, placed photos on the collage using Core Graphics, and finally exported and shared the collage as an image. This is just a basic implementation, and you can extend it further by adding more features and customization options.
