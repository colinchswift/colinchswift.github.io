## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The `AVCaptureSession` class provides an interface for managing the flow of information from the device's camera to your app. It allows you to set up a capture session and configure various inputs and outputs. PhotoKit, on the other hand, provides a high-level API for interacting with the device's photo library, making it easy to manage and manipulate photos within your app.

## Setting Up `AVCaptureSession` <a name="setting-up-avcapturesession"></a>

First, we need to configure and set up the `AVCaptureSession` to handle the camera input and output. We'll also need to request the necessary permissions from the user to access the camera.

```swift
import AVFoundation

// Check for camera permission
AVCaptureDevice.requestAccess(for: .video) { granted in
    if granted {
        // Permission granted, set up AVCaptureSession
        let captureSession = AVCaptureSession()
        
        // Configure the camera input
        guard let backCamera = AVCaptureDevice.default(for: .video),
            let input = try? AVCaptureDeviceInput(device: backCamera)
        else {
            return
        }
        
        // Add the camera input to the session
        if captureSession.canAddInput(input) {
            captureSession.addInput(input)
        }
        
        // Configure the photo output
        let photoOutput = AVCapturePhotoOutput()
        
        // Add the photo output to the session
        if captureSession.canAddOutput(photoOutput) {
            captureSession.addOutput(photoOutput)
        }
        
        // Start the session
        captureSession.startRunning()
    } else {
        // Camera permission not granted
        // Handle the error condition
    }
}
```

## Configuring the Camera Preview <a name="configuring-the-camera-preview"></a>

To display the camera preview on the screen, we can use `AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer`. This layer can be added to a view hierarchy, allowing users to see what the camera sees.

```swift
import UIKit
import AVFoundation

// Get the view to display the camera preview
let previewView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: view.bounds.width, height: view.bounds.height))

// Configure AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer
if let videoPreviewLayer = AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer(session: captureSession) {
    videoPreviewLayer.videoGravity = .resizeAspectFill
    videoPreviewLayer.frame = previewView.bounds

    // Add the preview layer to the view's layer
    previewView.layer.addSublayer(videoPreviewLayer)
}
```

## Implementing Photo Capture <a name="implementing-photo-capture"></a>

To capture a photo using `AVCaptureSession`, we can use the `AVCapturePhotoOutput` class. We need to configure the output to capture the desired photo settings and initiate the capture process.

```swift
import AVFoundation

let photoOutput = AVCapturePhotoOutput()

// Configure the photo settings
let photoSettings = AVCapturePhotoSettings()
photoSettings.flashMode = .auto
photoSettings.isAutoStillImageStabilizationEnabled = true

// Capture the photo
photoOutput.capturePhoto(with: photoSettings, delegate: self)
```

Don't forget to conform to the `AVCapturePhotoCaptureDelegate` and implement the appropriate delegate methods to handle the captured photo.

## Adding PhotoKit Integration <a name="adding-photokit-integration"></a>

Now, let's integrate PhotoKit to save the captured photo to the user's photo library.

```swift
import Photos

// Save the captured photo to the photo library
PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges({
    PHAssetChangeRequest.creationRequestForAsset(from: photo)
}, completionHandler: { success, error in
    if success {
        // Photo saved successfully
    } else {
        // Error saving the photo
        print("Error saving photo: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "")")
    }
})
```

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to save photos to the photo library by requesting the appropriate authorization from the user.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

In this tutorial, we learned how to implement a custom camera interface using `AVCaptureSession` and capture photos using `AVCapturePhotoOutput`. We also added PhotoKit integration to save the captured photos to the user's photo library. By leveraging these frameworks, you can provide users with a tailored camera experience within your app.
