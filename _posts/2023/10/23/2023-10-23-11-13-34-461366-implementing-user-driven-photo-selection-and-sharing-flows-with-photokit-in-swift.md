One of the most important features in many modern applications is the ability to allow users to select and share photos. Apple provides PhotoKit, a powerful framework, to handle all photo-related tasks in iOS applications. In this blog post, we will walk through the process of implementing user-driven photo selection and sharing flows using PhotoKit in Swift.

## Introduction to PhotoKit

PhotoKit is a framework provided by Apple that allows developers to fetch, edit, and share photos from the user's photo library. It provides a high-level API to interact with the user's photos in a seamless and secure manner.

## Requesting Authorization

Before accessing the user's photos, we need to request authorization to access the photo library. This is done by using the `PHPhotoLibrary` class and the `requestAuthorization(_:)` method. Here is an example of how to request authorization:

```swift
import Photos

PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization { status in
    // Handle authorization status
    if status == .authorized {
        // User granted access, proceed with fetching and displaying photos
    } else {
        // Authorization denied or restricted, handle accordingly
    }
}
```

## Fetching Photos

Once we have obtained authorization, we can fetch the user's photos using the `PHFetchResult` class. This class provides methods to fetch photos based on various criteria such as album, date, or media type. Here is an example of how to fetch all photos:

```swift
let fetchOptions = PHFetchOptions()
fetchOptions.sortDescriptors = [NSSortDescriptor(key: "creationDate", ascending: false)]

let fetchResult = PHAsset.fetchAssets(with: .image, options: fetchOptions)
```

## Displaying Photos

To display photos to the user, we can use the `PHImageManager` class to request thumbnail or full-sized images for the fetched assets. Here is an example of how to display a thumbnail image:

```swift
let asset = fetchResult.object(at: index)
let imageManager = PHImageManager.default()

let targetSize = CGSize(width: 100, height: 100) // Size of the thumbnail
let options = PHImageRequestOptions()
options.isSynchronous = false

imageManager.requestImage(for: asset, targetSize: targetSize, contentMode: .aspectFill, options: options) { image, _ in
    // Display the thumbnail image
}
```

## Selecting Photos

To allow users to select multiple photos, we can use the `UICollectionView` class to display the photos in a grid layout. When a user selects a photo, we can keep track of selected assets using an array or set. Here is an example of how to handle photo selection:

```swift
var selectedAssets = Set<PHAsset>()

func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, didSelectItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
    let asset = fetchResult.object(at: indexPath.item)
    selectedAssets.insert(asset)
}

func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, didDeselectItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
    let asset = fetchResult.object(at: indexPath.item)
    selectedAssets.remove(asset)
}
```

## Sharing Photos

Once the user has selected the desired photos, we can use the `UIActivityViewController` class to provide various sharing options to the user. This class handles the sharing flow, including sharing via messages, email, social media, and more. Here is an example of how to share selected photos:

```swift
var selectedImages = [UIImage]()

for asset in selectedAssets {
    // Retrieve the full-sized image for each selected asset
    let options = PHImageRequestOptions()
    options.isSynchronous = true

    imageManager.requestImage(for: asset, targetSize: PHImageManagerMaximumSize, contentMode: .aspectFit, options: options) { image, _ in
        if let image = image {
            selectedImages.append(image)
        }
    }
}

let activityViewController = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: selectedImages, applicationActivities: nil)
present(activityViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

## Conclusion

Implementing user-driven photo selection and sharing flows is made easier with PhotoKit in Swift. We covered the basics of requesting authorization, fetching and displaying photos, selecting multiple photos, and sharing them using PhotoKit. By leveraging the power of PhotoKit, you can provide an intuitive and seamless photo browsing and sharing experience for your users.
