In iOS, the PhotoKit framework provides powerful tools for working with the photo library on a user's device. One of these tools is the `PHChangeObserver`, which allows you to monitor and respond to changes in the photo library. This can be useful when you want to update your app's UI or perform additional actions based on changes in the user's photos.

To use the `PHChangeObserver`, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Create an instance of `PHChangeObserver`

First, create an instance of `PHChangeObserver` and implement its `photoLibraryDidChange(_:)` method. This method will be called whenever there are changes in the photo library.

```swift
class MyPhotoLibraryObserver: NSObject, PHPhotoLibraryChangeObserver {
    func photoLibraryDidChange(_ changeInstance: PHChange) {
        // Handle changes in the photo library
    }
}
```

## Step 2: Add the observer to the photo library

Next, add the observer to the photo library's `shared` instance:

```swift
let observer = MyPhotoLibraryObserver()
PHPhotoLibrary.shared().register(observer)
```

## Step 3: Handle changes in the photo library

In the `photoLibraryDidChange(_:)` method, you can use the `changeInstance` parameter to get the detailed information about the changes in the photo library. Here are some common tasks you might perform:

- Fetch newly added photos:
```swift
if let changeDetails = changeInstance.changeDetails(for: PHFetchResult<PHObject>()) {
    let newlyAddedPhotos = changeDetails.insertedObjects.compactMap { $0 as? PHAsset }
    // Do something with the newly added photos
}
```

- Update the UI when photos are deleted:
```swift
if let changeDetails = changeInstance.changeDetails(for: PHFetchResult<PHObject>()) {
    let deletedPhotos = changeDetails.removedObjects.compactMap { $0 as? PHAsset }
    // Update the UI to reflect the deletion of photos
}
```

- Perform actions when albums are changed:
```swift
if let changeDetails = changeInstance.changeDetails(for: PHFetchResult<PHObject>()) {
    let changedAlbums = changeDetails.changedObjects.compactMap { $0 as? PHAssetCollection }
    // Perform actions based on the changes to albums
}
```

## Step 4: Unregister the observer

Finally, when you no longer need to monitor changes in the photo library, make sure to unregister the observer to prevent any memory leaks:

```swift
PHPhotoLibrary.shared().unregisterChangeObserver(observer)
```

## Conclusion

Using the `PHChangeObserver` provided by PhotoKit allows you to easily monitor changes in the photo library and respond accordingly. Whether you need to update your app's UI or perform additional actions, the `PHChangeObserver` provides a flexible and efficient way to stay synchronized with the user's photo library.
