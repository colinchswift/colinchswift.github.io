Taking photos is a common activity for many people nowadays. However, sometimes our photos may have unwanted flaws like red-eye or blemishes that can detract from the overall quality of the image. Luckily, with the advancements in technology, there are tools available to help us easily fix these imperfections. One such tool is the PhotoKit framework, which provides developers with a set of powerful image editing capabilities.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use PhotoKit to remove red-eye and blemishes from photos programmatically. Let's dive in!

## What is PhotoKit?
[PhotoKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit) is a framework introduced by Apple that allows developers to access and edit photos in the user's photo library. It provides a wide range of functionalities, including editing tools like cropping, applying filters, adjusting brightness, and more.

## Removing red-eye
Red-eye is a common problem when taking photos, especially in low-light situations. It occurs when the camera flash reflects from the retinas of the subject, resulting in red-colored eyes in the captured image. To remove red-eye using PhotoKit, we can follow these steps:

1. Fetch the desired photo using PHAsset.
2. Create a PHContentEditingInputRequestOptions object and set the desired properties like canHandleAdjustmentData and isNetworkAccessAllowed.
3. Request PHContentEditingInput using the fetched PHAsset object and the PHContentEditingInputRequestOptions object.
4. Access the input object's fullSizeImageURL property to get the URL of the full-size photo.
5. Create a new CIFilter object with the filter type CIDetector.
6. Set the input image of the CIFilter to the full-size photo obtained from the URL.
7. Specify the filter type as CIDetectorTypeRedEye.
8. Apply the filter to the image using the CIFilter's outputImage property.
9. Create a PHAdjustmentData object with the filter's output image using the PHAdjustmentData.create(for: data) method.
10. Modify the image by creating a PHContentEditingOutput object and setting its adjustmentData property to the created PHAdjustmentData object.
11. Save the edited image using the PHImageManager.default().requestImageDataAndOrientation(for: data, ...) method.

By following these steps, we can successfully remove red-eye from photos using PhotoKit.

## Removing blemishes
Blemishes are another common issue in photos that can be easily fixed using PhotoKit. Blemishes refer to any unwanted spots or marks on the subject's skin, such as acne, scars, or wrinkles. To remove blemishes programmatically, we can use Core Image filters provided by PhotoKit. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Fetch the desired photo using PHAsset.
2. Create a PHContentEditingInputRequestOptions object and set the desired properties.
3. Request PHContentEditingInput using the fetched PHAsset object and the PHContentEditingInputRequestOptions object.
4. Access the input object's fullSizeImageURL property to get the URL of the full-size photo.
5. Create a new CIImage using the URL obtained from the previous step.
6. Create a new CIFilter object with the filter type CIRetouch.
7. Set the input image of the CIFilter to the CIImage created in step 5.
8. Specify the filter type as CISpotLight.
9. Adjust the filter's parameters like intensity and radius to remove the blemishes effectively.
10. Apply the filter to the image using the CIFilter's outputImage property.
11. Create a PHAdjustmentData object with the filter's output image using the PHAdjustmentData.create(for: data) method.
12. Modify the image by creating a PHContentEditingOutput object and setting its adjustmentData property to the created PHAdjustmentData object.
13. Save the edited image using the PHImageManager.default().requestImageDataAndOrientation(for: data, ...) method.

With these steps, blemishes can be easily removed from photos using PhotoKit's Core Image filters.

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we explored how to use PhotoKit's powerful image editing capabilities to remove red-eye and blemishes in photos programmatically. PhotoKit provides a straightforward API to access and modify photos, making it convenient for developers to integrate photo editing features into their apps. By following the steps outlined above, you can enhance the visual quality of your photos and deliver a better user experience.

Remember, PhotoKit offers various other editing capabilities, so feel free to explore its documentation and incorporate additional functionalities into your image editing projects!
