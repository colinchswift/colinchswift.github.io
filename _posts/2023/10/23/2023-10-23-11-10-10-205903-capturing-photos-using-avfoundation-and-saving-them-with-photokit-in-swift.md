In this tutorial, we will learn how to capture photos using AVFoundation and save them using PhotoKit in Swift. AVFoundation is a powerful framework that allows us to work with media capture and playback. PhotoKit, on the other hand, provides an easy way to save, retrieve, and manage photos in the user's photo library.

## Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>

To follow along with this tutorial, you should have basic knowledge of Swift and iOS development. Additionally, make sure you have Xcode installed on your machine.

## Setting up the Project<a name="setting-up-the-project"></a>

1. Open Xcode and create a new project. Choose the "Single View App" template and enter a name for your project.

2. In your project's **Info.plist** file, add the following keys:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to capture photos.</string>
```

This step is necessary to request camera permissions from users.

3. Import the AVFoundation and Photos frameworks in your view controller:

```swift
import AVFoundation
import Photos
```

## Capturing Photos<a name="capturing-photos"></a>

To capture photos, we need to configure and use an `AVCaptureSession`. First, create an instance of `AVCaptureSession` and configure it:

```swift
let captureSession = AVCaptureSession()

guard let captureDevice = AVCaptureDevice.default(for: .video) else {
    fatalError("Failed to get the camera device")
}

guard let input = try? AVCaptureDeviceInput(device: captureDevice) else {
    fatalError("Failed to create input from the capture device")
}

captureSession.addInput(input)
captureSession.startRunning()
```

Here, we obtain the default video capture device and create an `AVCaptureDeviceInput` from it. We then add the input to our capture session and start running it.

To display the camera preview on the screen, we can use a `AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer`:

```swift
let previewLayer = AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer(session: captureSession)
view.layer.addSublayer(previewLayer)
previewLayer.frame = view.frame
```

This code creates a preview layer and adds it as a sublayer to our view controller's view.

To capture a photo, we need to add a `AVCapturePhotoOutput` instance to our capture session:

```swift
let photoOutput = AVCapturePhotoOutput()

if captureSession.canAddOutput(photoOutput) {
    captureSession.addOutput(photoOutput)
}

let settings = AVCapturePhotoSettings()
photoOutput.capturePhoto(with: settings, delegate: self)
```

Here, we create a photo output object and add it to our capture session. We also create an instance of `AVCapturePhotoSettings` and use it to capture a photo.

To process the captured photo, we need to adopt the `AVCapturePhotoCaptureDelegate` protocol.

```swift
extension ViewController: AVCapturePhotoCaptureDelegate {

    func photoOutput(_ output: AVCapturePhotoOutput, didFinishProcessingPhoto photo: AVCapturePhoto, error: Error?) {
        guard let imageData = photo.fileDataRepresentation() else {
            fatalError("Failed to convert photo to data representation")
        }

        // Process the image data
    }
}
```

In this delegate method, we convert the captured photo to image data and process it as needed.

## Saving Photos with PhotoKit<a name="saving-photos-with-photokit"></a>

To save the captured photo to the user's photo library using PhotoKit, we need to import the `Photos` framework.

```swift
import Photos
```

Once we have the image data, we can save it to the photo library:

```swift
PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization { status in
    if status == .authorized {
        PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges({
            let creationRequest = PHAssetCreationRequest.forAsset()
            creationRequest.addResource(with: .photo, data: imageData, options: nil)
        }, completionHandler: { success, error in
            if success {
                print("Photo saved successfully")
            } else {
                print("Failed to save photo: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "Unknown error")")
            }
        })
    }
}
```

Here, we request authorization to access the photo library. If authorization is granted, we create a `PHAssetCreationRequest` and add the image data to it. Finally, we perform the changes and handle the completion.

## Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>

In this tutorial, we learned how to capture photos using AVFoundation and save them using PhotoKit in Swift. We configured an AVCaptureSession, captured a photo, and processed it. We also used PhotoKit to save the photo to the user's photo library. Incorporating these techniques into your app will allow you to provide a seamless photo capturing and saving experience for your users.
