RAW photos are unprocessed image files that contain all the raw sensor data captured by a camera. They provide greater flexibility and control over the final image output compared to JPEG or other compressed formats. In iOS and macOS, developers can leverage the power of PhotoKit to work with RAW photos and their associated metadata.

## What is PhotoKit?

PhotoKit is a powerful framework introduced by Apple that allows developers to access, manage, and manipulate the user's photo library. It provides a set of classes and APIs to interact with photos and videos, including RAW photos.

## Accessing RAW Photos

To work with RAW photos using PhotoKit, developers need to query the user's photo library and request access to the necessary permissions. Once access is granted, you can fetch the RAW photos using the `PHAsset` class and its `fetchAssets(with:options:)` method. You can specify the mediaType to filter and retrieve only RAW photos.

```swift
import Photos

let fetchOptions = PHFetchOptions()
fetchOptions.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "mediaType == %d", PHAssetMediaType.image.rawValue)
fetchOptions.includeAssetSourceTypes = [.typeUserLibrary]

let fetchResult = PHAsset.fetchAssets(with: fetchOptions)
    
fetchResult.enumerateObjects { (asset, _, _) in
    if asset.mediaSubtypes.contains(.photoRAW) {
        // This asset is a RAW photo
        // Perform further operations
    }
}
```

## Working with RAW Metadata

RAW photos contain a wealth of metadata that can provide valuable information about the capture settings, camera model, and more. You can use the `PHAsset`'s `requestMetadata(completionHandler:)` method to extract this metadata.

```swift
asset.requestMetadata { metadata, error in
    if let metadata = metadata {
        // Access the metadata
        let cameraModel = metadata[kCGImagePropertyExifDictionary as String]?[kCGImagePropertyExifLensModel as String] as? String
        let exposureTime = metadata[kCGImagePropertyExifDictionary as String]?[kCGImagePropertyExifExposureTime as String] as? NSNumber

        // Use the metadata for further processing or display
    } else {
        // Handle error
    }
}
```

## Editing RAW Photos

PhotoKit also allows you to edit RAW photos by applying adjustments like white balance, exposure, contrast, and more. You can leverage the `PHAdjustmentData` class to preserve non-destructive edits across multiple devices.

```swift
let rawSettings = PHAdjustmentData(formatIdentifier: "com.example.rawedit", formatVersion: "1.0", data: adjustmentData)
let editRequest = PHAssetChangeRequest(for: asset)
editRequest?.rawAdjustmentData = rawSettings
```

## Conclusion

PhotoKit provides a comprehensive framework for working with RAW photos and their metadata in iOS and macOS apps. You can access RAW photos, extract metadata, and even perform non-destructive edits. With its powerful capabilities, developers can create immersive photo editing experiences and empower users to unlock the full potential of their RAW images.
