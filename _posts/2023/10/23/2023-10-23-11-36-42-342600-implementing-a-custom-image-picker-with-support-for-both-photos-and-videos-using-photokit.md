When it comes to building a media-focused application, having a robust and customizable image picker is essential. In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement a custom image picker that supports both photos and videos using Apple's PhotoKit framework.

## Introduction to PhotoKit

PhotoKit is a powerful framework provided by Apple that allows developers to access and manipulate the user's photo library. It provides a high-level API for fetching and managing assets like photos and videos. With PhotoKit, we can easily create an image picker that supports various media types and provides a seamless browsing experience.

## Creating the Image Picker

To start, create a new project in Xcode and import the PhotoKit framework into your project. Next, create a new Swift file called `CustomImagePickerController` and define a class that subclasses `UIViewController`. This will act as the main view controller for our custom image picker.

```swift
import UIKit
import Photos

class CustomImagePickerController: UIViewController {

    // Your code goes here
    
}
```

## Fetching Photos and Videos

Next, we need to fetch the photos and videos from the user's photo library using PhotoKit. To do this, we'll use the `PHAsset` class to represent individual assets (photos or videos) and the `PHFetchResult` class to fetch a collection of assets.

```swift
class CustomImagePickerController: UIViewController {

    private var assets = [PHAsset]()
    
    private func fetchAssets() {
        let fetchOptions = PHFetchOptions()
        fetchOptions.sortDescriptors = [NSSortDescriptor(key: "creationDate", ascending: false)]
        
        let fetchResult = PHAsset.fetchAssets(with: fetchOptions)
        
        fetchResult.enumerateObjects { (asset, _, _) in
            self.assets.append(asset)
        }
    }
    
}
```

In the `fetchAssets` method, we set up a fetch request to retrieve all assets in the user's library, sorted by creation date in descending order. We then iterate over the fetch result and add each asset to our `assets` array.

## Displaying Thumbnails

To display thumbnails of the photos and videos in our custom image picker, let's create a UICollectionView and a custom UICollectionViewCell to represent each asset.

```swift
class CustomImagePickerController: UIViewController {
    
    private let imageCollectionView: UICollectionView = {
        // Initialize and configure your UICollectionView
        // Your code goes here
    }()
    
    // Your code goes here
    
    private func setupCollectionView() {
        // Configure the collection view layout, delegate, and data source
        // Your code goes here
    }
    
    private func configureCell(_ cell: UICollectionViewCell, at indexPath: IndexPath) {
        // Configure the cell to display the thumbnail image
        // Your code goes here
    }
    
}
```

In the `setupCollectionView` method, you should configure the collection view's layout, delegate, and data source. In the `configureCell` method, you can customize how each cell displays the thumbnail image.

## Selecting Photos and Videos

To allow the user to select photos and videos from the image picker, we can leverage the built-in multiple selection feature of UICollectionView. We'll update our code to handle selection and deselection of assets.

```swift
class CustomImagePickerController: UIViewController {
    
    private var selectedAssets = [PHAsset]()
    
    private func handleSelection(at indexPath: IndexPath) {
        let asset = assets[indexPath.item]
        
        if let index = selectedAssets.firstIndex(of: asset) {
            selectedAssets.remove(at: index)
        } else {
            selectedAssets.append(asset)
        }
        
        imageCollectionView.reloadItems(at: [indexPath])
    }
    
    private func configureCell(_ cell: UICollectionViewCell, at indexPath: IndexPath) {
        // Configure the cell's appearance based on selectedAssets
        // Your code goes here
    }
    
}
```

In the `handleSelection` method, we check if the selected asset is already in the `selectedAssets` array. If it is, we remove it; otherwise, we add it. Then, we reload the selected cell to update its appearance based on the selection status.

## Bringing It All Together

To make our custom image picker complete, we need to connect all the pieces we've implemented so far. In the main view controller, override the `viewDidLoad` method and call the necessary setup methods.

```swift
class CustomImagePickerController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        fetchAssets()
        setupCollectionView()
    }
    
    // Your code goes here
    
}
```

By calling `fetchAssets` and `setupCollectionView` in the `viewDidLoad` method, we ensure that our assets are fetched and displayed when the custom image picker is presented.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've explored how to implement a custom image picker using PhotoKit. We covered fetching photos and videos, displaying thumbnails, selecting assets, and bringing it all together. With this knowledge, you can now customize and enhance the image picker in your app to provide a rich media browsing experience for your users.
