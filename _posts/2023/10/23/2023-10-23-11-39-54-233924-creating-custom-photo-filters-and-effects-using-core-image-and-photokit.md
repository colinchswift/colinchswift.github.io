## Introduction
In this blog post, we will explore how to create custom photo filters and effects using Core Image and PhotoKit in iOS app development. Photo filters and effects can add a creative touch to the images and enhance the overall user experience in photo-related apps. By leveraging the power of Core Image and PhotoKit, we can easily apply custom filters to photos and provide a personalized photo editing experience.

## 1. Getting started with Core Image and PhotoKit <a name="getting-started"></a>
Core Image is a powerful framework provided by Apple that enables advanced image processing and manipulation. PhotoKit, on the other hand, is used for managing photo assets and interacting with the user's photo library. 

To begin, we need to import both Core Image and PhotoKit frameworks into our project. This can be done by adding the following import statements:

```swift
import CoreImage
import Photos
```

## 2. Applying filters using Core Image <a name="applying-filters"></a>
Core Image comes with a wide range of built-in filters that can be easily applied to images. To apply a filter, we follow these steps:

```swift
// 1. Create an instance of CIContext
let context = CIContext()

// 2. Load the image
let image = UIImage(named: "myImage.png")

// 3. Convert the UIImage to CIImage
guard let ciImage = CIImage(image: image) else {
    return
}

// 4. Create a filter
let filter = CIFilter(name: "CISepiaTone")

// 5. Set input image
filter?.setValue(ciImage, forKey: kCIInputImageKey)

// 6. Set filter parameters, if required
filter?.setValue(0.8, forKey: kCIInputIntensityKey)

// 7. Apply the filter and get the output image
guard let outputImage = filter?.outputImage else {
    return
}

// 8. Create a CGImage from CIImage
guard let cgImage = context.createCGImage(outputImage, from: outputImage.extent) else {
    return
}

// 9. Create a UIImage from CGImage
let filteredImage = UIImage(cgImage: cgImage)
```

## 3. Creating custom filters <a name="custom-filters"></a>
Core Image also allows us to create custom filters by subclassing `CIFilter`. This gives us the flexibility to define our own image processing algorithms for creating unique effects.

To create a custom filter, we need to:

- Subclass `CIFilter` and implement the methods required for the filter.
- Define input and output properties using `@objc` and `dynamic`.
- Implement `outputImage` property to apply the filter to the input image.

For example, let's create a custom filter called "VintageFilter" that adds a vintage effect to the image:

```swift
class VintageFilter: CIFilter {
    @objc dynamic var inputImage: CIImage?
    
    override var outputImage: CIImage? {
        guard let inputImage = inputImage,
              let filter = CIFilter(name: "CISepiaTone") else {
            return nil
        }
        
        filter.setValue(inputImage, forKey: kCIInputImageKey)
        filter.setValue(0.8, forKey: kCIInputIntensityKey)
        
        return filter.outputImage
    }
}
```

## 4. Integrating with PhotoKit <a name="integrating-with-photokit"></a>
To provide a seamless photo editing experience, we can integrate our custom filters with PhotoKit. PhotoKit allows us to fetch photos from the user's photo library, apply filters, and save the edited image back to the library.

To integrate with PhotoKit, we need to:

- Request the necessary permissions to access the photo library.
- Fetch and display the photos using `PHAsset` and `PHImageManager`.
- Apply our custom filters using Core Image.
- Save the edited image back to the photo library using `PHPhotoLibrary`.

For a detailed explanation of integrating with PhotoKit, refer to the official [PhotoKit documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit).

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
By leveraging the powerful capabilities of Core Image and PhotoKit, we can easily create custom photo filters and effects in our iOS apps. The combination of Core Image's built-in filters and the ability to create custom filters gives us endless possibilities to enhance and personalize the photo editing experience. Integrating with PhotoKit allows us to seamlessly fetch, edit, and save photos, providing a complete photo editing solution.
