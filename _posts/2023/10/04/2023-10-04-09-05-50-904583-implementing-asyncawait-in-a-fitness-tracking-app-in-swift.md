With the release of Swift 5.5, Apple introduced the `async` and `await` keywords, making it easier than ever to write asynchronous code in Swift. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement `async/await` in a fitness tracking app, allowing us to fetch data from a remote API in a clean and concise manner.

## Understanding async/await <a name="understanding-async-await"></a>
`async/await` is a programming pattern that allows you to write asynchronous code that looks similar to synchronous code. It simplifies the process of handling asynchronous operations by allowing you to write code in a linear fashion, without the need for complex callback functions or chaining promises.

When a function is marked with the `async` keyword, it can contain `await` expressions. The `await` keyword suspends the execution of the function until the awaited asynchronous operation completes, and then resumes the execution.

## Implementing async/await in a fitness tracking app <a name="implementing-async-await"></a>
Let's imagine we have a fitness tracking app that needs to fetch the user's daily steps from a remote API. We can implement this using `async/await` in the following way:

```swift
import Foundation

struct StepData: Codable {
    let date: String
    let steps: Int
}

func fetchSteps() async throws -> [StepData] {
    let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/steps")!
    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
    return try JSONDecoder().decode([StepData].self, from: data)
}
```

In this example, we define a struct `StepData` to represent the data we retrieve from the API. The `fetchSteps` function is marked as `async` to indicate that it contains asynchronous code. It uses `await` to retrieve the data from the remote API and then decodes it using `JSONDecoder`.

To use this `fetchSteps` function, we can call it from another `async` function or closure. For example:

```swift
func displaySteps() async {
    do {
        let steps = try await fetchSteps()
        for stepData in steps {
            print("\(stepData.date): \(stepData.steps) steps")
        }
    } catch {
        print("Error fetching steps: \(error)")
    }
}
```

Here, we define a `displaySteps` function that calls `fetchSteps` using `await`. We can handle any errors that occur during the asynchronous operation using a `catch` block.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
With the introduction of `async/await` in Swift 5.5, writing asynchronous code has become much cleaner and more readable. In this blog post, we explored how to implement `async/await` in a fitness tracking app to fetch data from a remote API. By leveraging this new feature, we can write asynchronous code in a more synchronous and intuitive manner, making our apps more robust and user-friendly.
