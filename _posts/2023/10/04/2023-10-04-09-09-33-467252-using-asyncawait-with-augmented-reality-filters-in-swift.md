Augmented reality (AR) filters have become increasingly popular in mobile applications, allowing users to overlay digital content on the real world. In Swift, developers can leverage the power of `async/await` to create a smoother and more efficient user experience when applying AR filters.

## What is async/await in Swift?

`async/await` is a new feature introduced in Swift 5.5 that simplifies asynchronous programming. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a more sequential and readable manner. Instead of using completion handlers or callbacks, you can now use the `async` and `await` keywords to handle asynchronous tasks.

## Applying an AR filter asynchronously

Let's say you have an ARKit-based application and you want to apply a filter to the camera feed in real-time. Here's an example of how you can utilize `async/await` to achieve this:

```swift
import ARKit
import AVFoundation

func applyFilterAsync() async throws {
    let session = ARSession()
    let configuration = ARWorldTrackingConfiguration()
    session.run(configuration)
    
    guard let camera = session.currentFrame?.camera else {
        throw CameraError.noCameraFeed
    }
    
    try await applyARFilter(camera)
}

func applyARFilter(_ camera: ARCamera) async throws {
    let inputImage = CIImage(cvPixelBuffer: camera.pixelBuffer)
    let filteredImage = try await applyCustomFilter(inputImage)
    
    // Display the filtered image on the AR scene
}

func applyCustomFilter(_ inputImage: CIImage) async throws -> CIImage {
    let filter = CustomFilter()
    filter.setValue(inputImage, forKey: kCIInputImageKey)
    
    guard let outputImage = filter.outputImage else {
        throw FilterError.invalidInputImage
    }
    
    return outputImage
}
```

In the above code snippet, we have a function `applyFilterAsync` that sets up an AR session and applies the AR filter asynchronously. Inside the async function, we first retrieve the camera feed from the AR session. We then pass the camera feed to the `applyARFilter` function, which applies a custom AR filter to the input image using `async/await`. Finally, we display the filtered image on the AR scene.

## Handling errors with async/await

When working with async/await, you can handle errors using the `throws` keyword. In the example code above, both `applyFilterAsync` and `applyCustomFilter` functions may throw an error if something goes wrong. By marking the functions with `throws`, you can catch and handle the errors using try-catch blocks.

```swift
do {
    try await applyFilterAsync()
    // Success
} catch {
    // Handle the error
}
```

## Conclusion

Using `async/await` with AR filters in Swift can greatly improve the performance and readability of your code. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a more sequential manner, making it easier to understand and maintain. By embracing this new feature, you can create immersive and interactive AR experiences for your users. Don't forget to make use of error handling to handle any potential issues that may arise.
