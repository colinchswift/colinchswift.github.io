With the introduction of `async/await` in Swift 5.5, writing asynchronous code has become much cleaner and easier to read. `async/await` allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous-like manner, making your code more intuitive and easier to follow. In this article, we will explore some best practices for writing clean and readable `async/await` code in Swift.

## Use Descriptive Function and Variable Names {#descriptive-names}

Using descriptive names for your `async` functions and variables will improve the readability of your code significantly. Choose names that clearly convey the purpose and functionality of the asynchronous task. For example:

```swift
func downloadData(from url: URL) async throws -> Data {
    // ...
}

let imageData: Data = try await downloadData(from: imageURL)
```

By using descriptive names like `downloadData(from:)` instead of generic names like `getData`, it is easier to understand what the function does at a glance.

When using `async` closures, also remember to provide descriptive names for your closure parameters. This will help make the closure's purpose and expected arguments clear to anyone reading the code.

## Avoid Long and Nested `async` Functions {#avoid-long-nested-functions}

Long and deeply nested `async` functions can quickly become hard to understand and maintain. It's generally a good practice to keep your `async` functions short and focused on a single task. If you find that a function is becoming too long, consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions.

Additionally, try to avoid unnecessary nesting of `async` functions. Instead, use `await` to await the results of previous asynchronous tasks before proceeding to the next step. This will help maintain a linear flow and improve readability. For example:

```swift
func fetchDataAndProcess() async {
    let data = try await fetchData()
    let processedData = await process(data)
    // ...
}
```

By avoiding deep nesting, your code will be easier to follow and understand.

## Handle Errors Properly {#handle-errors}

Error handling is an essential part of writing robust `async/await` code. Swift's `async/await` allows you to conveniently handle errors using the `throws` keyword. Ensure that you handle errors appropriately to prevent crashes or unexpected behavior.

When calling an `async` function that can throw an error, use `try await` to catch and handle any errors. Handle the errors at the appropriate level to ensure that they don't propagate throughout your codebase.

```swift
do {
    let results = try await performNetworkRequest()
    // Process the results
} catch {
    // Handle the error
}
```

By properly handling errors, you enable your code to gracefully handle unexpected situations and provide better feedback to the user.

## Utilize Structured Concurrency {#structured-concurrency}

With the introduction of `async/await`, Swift also brings structured concurrency. Structured concurrency helps manage the lifecycle of concurrent tasks and ensures that all tasks complete or fail together. To harness the benefits of structured concurrency, use it when launching and managing concurrent tasks.

```swift
async let dataTask = fetchData()
async let imageTask = downloadImage()

let data = try await dataTask
let image = try await imageTask

// Use the data and image
```

By using structured concurrency, you can easily parallelize tasks and manage their dependencies, making your code more organized and maintainable.

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

Using `async/await` in Swift allows you to write asynchronous code that is clean, readable, and easier to understand. By following the best practices mentioned in this article, you can ensure that your `async/await` code is maintainable and efficient, resulting in a better developer experience and improved application performance.
