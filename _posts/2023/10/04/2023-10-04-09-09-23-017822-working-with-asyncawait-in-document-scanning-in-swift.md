With the introduction of Swift 5.5, a new concurrency model has been added which includes the `async` and `await` keywords. This new model greatly simplifies asynchronous programming, making it easier to work with tasks that perform time-consuming operations. In this blog post, we will explore how to leverage `async` and `await` in document scanning in Swift, enabling us to efficiently process scanned documents in our iOS apps.

## Scanning a Document

To start, we need to scan a document using the device's camera to capture the image. We can use the `AVCaptureSession` class to configure and control the camera. Here's an example of how to set up a basic scanning session:

```swift
import AVFoundation

func startScanning() async throws -> AVCaptureDeviceInput {
    guard let device = AVCaptureDevice.default(for: .video) else {
        throw ScannerError.cameraNotFound
    }
    
    let input = try AVCaptureDeviceInput(device: device)
    
    // Configure the capture session and start scanning
    
    return input
}
```

The `startScanning()` function is marked as `async` to indicate that it is an asynchronous operation. The `throws` keyword indicates that it can potentially throw an error. Inside the function, we first check if the device supports video capture, and if so, create an instance of `AVCaptureDeviceInput` with the device. We then configure the capture session and start scanning.

## Processing the Scanned Document

Once we have scanned the document and obtained an image, we can use `async` and `await` to process the document in the background without blocking the main thread. Let's take a look at an example:

```swift
import Vision

func processScannedDocument(image: UIImage) async throws -> String {
    let request = VNRecognizeTextRequest { request, error in
        if let error = error {
            throw ScannerError.documentProcessingError(error)
        }
        
        guard let observations = request.results as? [VNRecognizedTextObservation] else {
            throw ScannerError.documentProcessingError
        }
        
        // Process the recognized text observations
        
        // Return the resulting text or perform other operations
    }
    
    let handler = VNImageRequestHandler(cgImage: image.cgImage!)
    
    try await handler.perform([request])
    
    // Return the resulting text or perform other operations
}
```

In this example, we use the Vision framework to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the scanned document. The `processScannedDocument()` function takes an image as input and uses `VNRecognizeTextRequest` to recognize text in the image. Inside the completion handler, we handle any errors that might occur during the processing and process the recognized text observations.

We then create an instance of `VNImageRequestHandler` with the image and use `await` to asynchronously perform the request. This allows us to process the document without blocking the main thread. Finally, we can return the resulting text or perform any other relevant operations.

## Conclusion

By leveraging the `async` and `await` keywords in Swift, we can easily work with asynchronous operations, such as document scanning and processing, in our iOS apps. The new concurrency model introduced in Swift 5.5 simplifies the code and improves the readability of async operations. With this powerful feature, developers can build more responsive and efficient apps.

Incorporating async/await into document scanning in Swift can streamline your app's functionality and deliver an improved user experience. Happy coding!
