In asynchronous programming, it's important to handle retries and timeouts to ensure the reliability and responsiveness of your code. In this blog post, we'll explore techniques to handle retries and timeouts in Swift using async/await.

## Retries <a name="retries"></a>

Retrying a failed asynchronous operation can be useful when dealing with intermittent failures or transient network issues. Let's look at a couple of approaches to implement retries in async/await Swift code.

### Retry with Fixed Delay <a name="retry-with-fixed-delay"></a>

One simple way to implement retries is to introduce a fixed delay between each retry attempt. Here's an example of a function that retries an async operation with a fixed delay:

```swift
@asyncHandler
func retryWithFixedDelay<T>(maxRetries: Int, delay: TimeInterval, operation: @async () throws -> T) async throws -> T {
    for _ in 0..<maxRetries {
        do {
            let result = try await operation()
            return result
        } catch {
            await Task.sleep(UInt64(delay * 1_000_000_000))
        }
    }
    throw RetryError.maxRetriesExceeded
}
```

In this example, the `retryWithFixedDelay` function takes the maximum number of retries, the delay between retries, and the asynchronous operation to be retried. It loops through the retry attempts, catching any errors and pausing the execution for the specified delay before retrying.

### Exponential Backoff Retry <a name="exponential-backoff-retry"></a>

Another commonly used retry strategy is exponential backoff. In this approach, the delay between retries increases exponentially with each retry attempt. Here's an example of a function that implements exponential backoff retry:

```swift
@asyncHandler
func exponentialBackoffRetry<T>(maxRetries: Int, baseDelay: TimeInterval, operation: @async () throws -> T) async throws -> T {
    var delay: TimeInterval = baseDelay
    for _ in 0..<maxRetries {
        do {
            let result = try await operation()
            return result
        } catch {
            await Task.sleep(UInt64(delay * 1_000_000_000))
            delay *= 2
        }
    }
    throw RetryError.maxRetriesExceeded
}
```

In this example, the `exponentialBackoffRetry` function takes the maximum number of retries, the base delay for the first retry, and the asynchronous operation to be retried. After each failed attempt, it multiplies the delay by 2 to exponentially increase the waiting time between retries.

## Timeouts <a name="timeouts"></a>

In addition to retries, timeouts are also essential to prevent indefinite waiting for a response or an operation to complete. Let's explore two ways to implement timeouts in async/await Swift code.

### Timeout with asyncAfter <a name="timeout-with-asyncafter"></a>

One approach to implementing a timeout is by using `asyncAfter` to dispatch a block of code after a specific time interval. Here's an example of a function that adds a timeout to an async operation using `asyncAfter`:

```swift
@asyncHandler
func withTimeout<T>(timeout: TimeInterval, operation: @async () throws -> T) async throws -> T {
    let timeoutTask = await Task { @asyncHandler in
        try? await Task.sleep(UInt64(timeout * 1_000_000_000))
        Task.detached {
            throw TimeoutError.timeout
        }
    }
    do {
        let result = try await operation()
        timeoutTask.cancel()
        return result
    } catch {
        timeoutTask.cancel()
        throw error
    }
}
```

In this example, the `withTimeout` function takes a timeout duration and the asynchronous operation to be executed. It creates a `timeoutTask` using `asyncAfter` to throw a `TimeoutError.timeout` error after the specified timeout duration. The function then awaits the operation, cancelling the `timeoutTask` if the operation completes before the timeout.

### Cancellation with Timeout <a name="cancellation-with-timeout"></a>

Another way to handle timeouts is by using explicit cancellation. Here's an example of a function that accomplishes this using a `withCancellation` pattern:

```swift
@asyncHandler
func withTimeout<T>(timeout: TimeInterval, operation: @async () throws -> T) async throws -> T {
    let cancellationToken = CancellationToken()
    let timeoutTask = Task { @asyncHandler in
        try? await Task.sleep(UInt64(timeout * 1_000_000_000))
        cancellationToken.cancel()
    }

    do {
        let result = try await withCancellation(cancellationToken) {
            try await operation()
        }
        timeoutTask.cancel()
        return result
    } catch {
        timeoutTask.cancel()
        throw error
    }
}
```

In this example, the `withTimeout` function creates a `CancellationToken` to control the operation's cancellation. It creates a `timeoutTask` that cancels the `cancellationToken` after the specified timeout duration. The function then calls `withCancellation` to wrap the operation's execution while considering the cancellation token.

## Conclusion

By implementing retries and timeouts in your async/await Swift code, you can enhance the reliability and responsiveness of your asynchronous operations. Whether you choose fixed delay retries or exponential backoff and asyncAfter or cancellation, adapt these techniques to suit your specific use cases and create more robust asynchronous code.
