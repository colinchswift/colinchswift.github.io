With the release of Swift 5.5, Apple introduced the ability to use `async` and `await` for writing asynchronous code. This makes it much easier to write and understand asynchronous operations, such as network requests, in a more synchronous manner. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement `async/await` in a real-time chat app using Swift.

## Setting up the project ##

Before we dive into implementing `async/await`, let's first set up our project. Create a new Swift project or open an existing one, and make sure you have Swift 5.5 or later selected as the language version.

## Implementing the chat service ##

To demonstrate the use of `async/await`, let's create a basic chat service that sends and receives messages in real-time. We will be using a third-party library like `Socket.IO` to handle the real-time communication.

First, let's install the `Socket.IO` library using Swift Package Manager. Open your project and go to `File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency`. Enter the repository URL for `Socket.IO` and select the appropriate version.

```swift
import SocketIO

class ChatService {
    let socketManager: SocketManager
    let socket: SocketIOClient
    
    init() {
        socketManager = SocketManager(socketURL: URL(string: "http://your-server-url.com")!)
        socket = socketManager.defaultSocket
        
        setupSocketListeners()
    }
    
    func connect() async throws {
        do {
            await socket.connect()
        } catch {
            throw ChatServiceError.connectionFailed
        }
    }
    
    func disconnect() async {
        await socket.disconnect()
    }
    
    func sendMessage(_ message: String) async throws {
        do {
            await socket.emitWithAck("message", with: [message]).wait()
        } catch {
            throw ChatServiceError.sendMessageFailed
        }
    }
    
    func setupSocketListeners() {
        socket.on("message") { data, ack in
            guard let message = data.first as? String else {
                return
            }
            
            // Handle received message
        }
    }
}
```

In the code above, we have created a `ChatService` class that handles the real-time communication with the server using `Socket.IO`. The methods `connect()`, `disconnect()`, and `sendMessage(_:)` are marked as `async` to indicate that they can be awaited.

## Using async/await in the view controller ##

Now that we have implemented the `ChatService` with `async/await` support, let's see how we can use it in our view controller to send and receive messages.

```swift
class ChatViewController: UIViewController {
    let chatService = ChatService()
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        Task.init {
            do {
                try await chatService.connect()
                
                await chatService.sendMessage("Hello, world!")
            } catch {
                print("Error: \(error)")
            }
        }
    }
    
    override func viewWillDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewWillDisappear(animated)
        
        Task.init {
            await chatService.disconnect()
        }
    }
}
```

In the code above, we create an instance of the `ChatService` in our view controller. In the `viewDidLoad()` method, we use `async/await` to connect to the chat service and send a message. In the `viewWillDisappear()` method, we use `async/await` to disconnect from the chat service.

## Conclusion ##

With the introduction of `async/await` in Swift, writing asynchronous code has become much more readable and straightforward. In this blog post, we explored how to implement `async/await` in a real-time chat app using Swift. By using `async/await`, we can simplify the asynchronous operations and make our code more maintainable and easier to reason about.
