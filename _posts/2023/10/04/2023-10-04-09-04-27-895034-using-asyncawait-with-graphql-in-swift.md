GraphQL has become a popular choice for building APIs due to its flexibility and efficiency. And with the introduction of async/await in Swift 5.5, handling asynchronous operations has become even easier. In this blog post, we will explore how to use async/await with GraphQL in Swift to make our code cleaner and more readable.

## Setting up GraphQL in Swift

Before we dive into using async/await, let's first set up GraphQL in our Swift project. There are a few libraries available that can help us interact with GraphQL APIs, such as Apollo and GraphQL.swift. For this example, let's use Apollo, as it provides a seamless integration with async/await.

To use Apollo in your Swift project, you can add it as a dependency using Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods, depending on your project setup. Make sure to follow the installation instructions provided by the Apollo library.

## Making GraphQL Requests with async/await

Once you have Apollo set up in your project, you can start making GraphQL requests using async/await. Let's take a look at an example of how to fetch data from a GraphQL API using async/await in Swift.

```swift
import Apollo

async func fetchGraphQLData() {
    let apollo = ApolloClient(url: URL(string: "https://api.example.com/graphql")!)
    
    do {
        let query = MyGraphQLQuery()
        let result = try await apollo.fetch(query: query)
        
        if let data = result.data {
            // Process the fetched data
        } else if let errors = result.errors {
            // Handle GraphQL errors
        }
    } catch {
        // Handle network or GraphQL errors
    }
}
```

In the above code snippet, we define an `async` function `fetchGraphQLData` that uses the Apollo library to make a GraphQL query. We create an instance of `ApolloClient` and pass the URL of the GraphQL API as a parameter. Then, we define our GraphQL query using a generated query class, in this case, `MyGraphQLQuery`.

We use the `await` keyword to asynchronously fetch the GraphQL data and store the result in the `result` variable. If the data is successfully fetched, we can process it further. If there are any GraphQL errors, we can handle them accordingly by accessing the `errors` property of the `result`.

Using async/await with GraphQL in Swift allows us to write clean, sequential code that is easier to read and understand. It eliminates the need for nested completion handlers or callbacks, making our code more maintainable.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to use async/await with GraphQL in Swift using the Apollo library. We have seen how async/await simplifies the handling of asynchronous operations, making our code cleaner and more readable.

Using async/await with GraphQL in Swift can greatly enhance the developer experience and improve the overall efficiency of our codebase. It allows us to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous and intuitive manner.

Remember to always refer to the documentation provided by the GraphQL library you are using for more details and advanced usage scenarios.
