Cryptocurrency apps often need to make asynchronous network requests to retrieve data from APIs. In Swift, we can use the async/await pattern to write clean and concise code that handles these asynchronous operations.

In this blog post, we will walk through the process of implementing async/await in a cryptocurrency app using Swift 5.5. Let's get started!

## What is async/await?

Async/await is a programming pattern that allows you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous and readable manner. It was introduced in Swift 5.5 and leverages Swift's `async` and `await` keywords.

Using async/await, you can write asynchronous code that appears to run in a sequential and synchronous way, making it easier to understand and maintain.

## Using async/await in Swift

### Async functions

To use async/await, you need to mark a function as `async`. This indicates that the function contains asynchronous code and can be awaited. Here's an example of an async function declaration:

```swift
async func fetchData() -> Data {
    // Perform asynchronous operations
    // ...

    return data
}
```

### Awaiting asynchronous tasks

To await an asynchronous task, you use the `await` keyword. It ensures that the execution of the code waits until the asynchronous task completes and returns a value. Here's an example:

```swift
let data = await fetchData()
```

Now that we understand the basic concepts of async/await, let's dive into an example of using it in a cryptocurrency app.

## Example: Fetching cryptocurrency data

### Creating a network request

First, we need to create a network request that retrieves cryptocurrency data from an API. We can use the `URLSession` class to make the network request asynchronously. Here's an example of a function that performs the network request:

```swift
func fetchData(completion: @escaping (Result<Data, Error>) -> Void) {
    guard let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/cryptocurrency") else {
        completion(.failure(NetworkError.invalidURL))
        return
    }

    let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in
        if let error = error {
            completion(.failure(error))
            return
        }

        if let data = data {
            completion(.success(data))
        } else {
            completion(.failure(NetworkError.emptyResponse))
        }
    }

    task.resume()
}
```

### Using async/await to fetch data

Now, let's refactor the `fetchData` function to use async/await instead of a completion handler. We will convert it into an async function that returns the fetched data directly. Here's the updated code:

```swift
func fetchData() async throws -> Data {
    guard let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/cryptocurrency") else {
        throw NetworkError.invalidURL
    }

    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)

    return data
}
```

Notice how we've marked the function as `async` and replaced the completion handler with the `throws` keyword. Instead of calling `dataTask` directly, we now use `data(from:)` which is an asynchronous function that returns a tuple containing the data and response.

### Error handling with async/await

In the previous example, we added the `throws` keyword to indicate that the function can throw an error. You can handle errors using a try-catch block when calling the async function:

```swift
do {
    let data = try await fetchData()
    // Process the fetched data
} catch {
    // Handle the error
}
```

By using async/await, we have simplified the code by removing the need for callback functions and chaining multiple async operations. The code becomes more readable and easier to understand.

## Conclusion

Async/await is a powerful addition to Swift that simplifies asynchronous programming. By using async/await in your cryptocurrency app, you can make your code more readable and maintainable while handling asynchronous network requests.

In this article, we walked through the basics of using async/await in Swift and implemented async/await in a cryptocurrency app for fetching data. Start leveraging async/await in your Swift projects and make your asynchronous code more intuitive and concise.
