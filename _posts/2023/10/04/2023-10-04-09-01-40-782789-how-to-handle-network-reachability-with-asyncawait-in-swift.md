In modern app development, it is crucial to handle network reachability in order to provide a seamless user experience. With the introduction of async/await in Swift 5.5, handling network reachability has become even easier and more efficient. In this blog post, we will explore how to use async/await to handle network reachability in Swift.

## Introduction

Before we dive into the details, let's have a quick overview of network reachability. Network reachability refers to the ability of a device to access the internet or a specific network. By monitoring network reachability, we can determine whether the device is connected to the internet or not.

## Checking Network Reachability

To check network reachability in Swift, we can use the `Network` framework. First, we need to import the `Network` framework. Add the following import statement at the top of your file:

```swift
import Network
```

Next, we can use the `NWPathMonitor` class to monitor the network path. Here's an example of how to check network reachability using `NWPathMonitor`:

```swift
let monitor = NWPathMonitor()
let queue = DispatchQueue.global()

monitor.start(queue: queue)

monitor.pathUpdateHandler = { path in
    if path.status == .satisfied {
        print("Network is reachable")
    } else {
        print("Network is not reachable")
    }
}
```

## Handling Network Reachability Changes

Now that we know how to check network reachability, let's explore how to handle network reachability changes. We can use the `NWPathMonitor`'s `pathUpdateHandler` to listen for changes in network reachability. Here's an example of how to handle network reachability changes:

```swift
monitor.pathUpdateHandler = { path in
    if path.status == .satisfied {
        print("Network is reachable")
    } else {
        print("Network is not reachable")
    }
}
```

By implementing the `pathUpdateHandler`, we can execute specific actions whenever the network reachability changes. For example, we can update the UI to show a message when the network is not reachable.

## Using async/await

With the introduction of async/await in Swift 5.5, we can now handle network reachability using asynchronous code. This allows us to write more readable and concise code. Let's see how async/await can be used to handle network reachability:

```swift
@MainActor
func checkNetworkReachability() async throws -> Bool {
    let monitor = NWPathMonitor()
    let queue = DispatchQueue.global()

    monitor.start(queue: queue)

    let path = try await withCheckedThrowingContinuation { continuation in
        monitor.pathUpdateHandler = { path in
            continuation.resume(returning: path)
        }
    }
    
    return path.status == .satisfied
}
```

In the example above, we defined an `async` function `checkNetworkReachability()` that returns a `Bool` representing whether the network is reachable or not. We use the `withCheckedThrowingContinuation` function to suspend the function until the network path is updated. Once the `pathUpdateHandler` is called, we resume the continuation with the updated path.

## Conclusion

Handling network reachability is an important aspect of app development, and with the advent of async/await in Swift 5.5, it has become even easier and more efficient. By using the `NWPathMonitor` class and async/await, we can check network reachability and handle its changes in a concise and readable way. Incorporating network reachability handling in your app will ensure a seamless user experience.

Remember to import the Network framework, check the network status using `NWPathMonitor`, and utilize async/await to handle network reachability changes. Happy coding! ðŸš€
