Animations play a crucial role in creating a smooth and engaging user experience in iOS apps. With the introduction of async/await in Swift 5.5, handling asynchronous tasks, such as animations, has become more streamlined and elegant. In this blog post, we will explore how to use async/await with UIKit animations in Swift.

## Introduction to async/await

Async/await is a new way of writing asynchronous code in Swift. It allows developers to write asynchronous operations in a sequential and intuitive manner, similar to writing synchronous code. By using the `async` and `await` keywords, you can easily handle asynchronous tasks without the need for callbacks or completion handlers.

## Using async/await with UIKit animations

Prior to Swift 5.5, performing animations with UIKit involved using completion blocks or delegates to handle the animation's completion. With async/await, you can now simplify this process by writing animation code in a linear and readable way.

To use async/await with UIKit animations, follow these steps:

1. Import the UIKit framework at the top of your Swift file:
   
```swift
import UIKit
```

2. Wrap your animation code inside an `async` function:
   
```swift
func animateView() async {
    // Your animation code here
}
```

3. Encapsulate your UIKit animation code within a `withTaskCancellationHandler` block:
   
```swift
func animateView() async {
    await withTaskCancellationHandler { [weak self] in
        // Your animation code here
    }
}
```

4. Use the `Task.sleep` function to introduce a delay between animations:
   
```swift
func animateView() async {
    await withTaskCancellationHandler { [weak self] in
        // Your first animation code here
        
        Task.sleep(1_000_000_000) // 1 second delay
        
        // Your second animation code here
    }
}
```

5. Use `try` and `await` to ensure the animation completes before continuing execution:
   
```swift
func animateView() async {
    await withTaskCancellationHandler { [weak self] in
        // Your first animation code here
        try await UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.5) {
            // Animation properties
        }
        
        Task.sleep(1_000_000_000) // 1 second delay
        
        // Your second animation code here
        try await UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.5) {
            // Animation properties
        }
    }
}
```

With async/await, you can now perform multiple animations one after another, with delays in between, without the need for complex completion handlers or callbacks. It greatly simplifies the animation code and enhances its readability.

## Example code

Here's an example of how you can use async/await with UIKit animations in Swift:

```swift
import UIKit

func animateView() async {
    await withTaskCancellationHandler { [weak self] in
        try await UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.5) {
            self?.view.alpha = 0.0
        }
        
        Task.sleep(1_000_000_000) // 1 second delay
        
        try await UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.5) {
            self?.view.alpha = 1.0
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `animateView` function animates a view by fading it out and then fading it back in after a 1-second delay.

## Conclusion

Using async/await with UIKit animations in Swift allows for cleaner and more readable code. By eliminating the need for nested completion blocks or delegates, async/await simplifies the animation process and improves the overall code structure. Start leveraging the power of async/await in your iOS apps to create delightful and engaging user experiences.
