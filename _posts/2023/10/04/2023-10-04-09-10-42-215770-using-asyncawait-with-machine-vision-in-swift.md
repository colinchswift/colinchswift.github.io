Asynchronous programming has become an essential concept in modern software development. It allows developers to write concurrent code that doesn't block the main thread, leading to better app performance and responsiveness. With the release of Swift 5.5, Apple introduced the `async/await` syntax, making asynchronous programming even easier and more readable. In this article, we'll explore how we can use `async/await` with Machine Vision in Swift.

## What is Machine Vision?

Machine Vision is a framework provided by Apple that allows developers to perform computer vision tasks using the built-in camera or image processing algorithms. It provides high-level APIs for face detection, text recognition, barcode scanning, and more. Using Machine Vision, we can build powerful image analysis features into our apps.

## Asynchronous Programming with `async/await`

Before Swift 5.5, handling asynchronous tasks involved using completion handlers or delegates, which could lead to callback hell and difficult-to-read code. With the introduction of `async/await`, Swift now follows a more sequential programming style, even when executing asynchronous tasks.

To use `async/await` with Machine Vision, we need to wrap our asynchronous code inside a function marked with `async`. This allows us to use the `await` keyword to wait for the asynchronous task to complete without blocking the main thread.

Here's an example of how we can use `async/await` with Machine Vision to detect faces in an image:

```swift
import UIKit
import Vision

func detectFaces(in image: UIImage) async throws -> [VNFaceObservation] {
    guard let ciImage = CIImage(image: image) else {
        throw NSError(domain: "InvalidImage", code: -1, userInfo: nil)
    }
    
    let faceDetectionRequest = VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest()
    
    let faceDetectionHandler = VNImageRequestHandler(ciImage: ciImage, options: [:])
    try await faceDetectionHandler.perform([faceDetectionRequest])
    
    guard let faceObservations = faceDetectionRequest.results as? [VNFaceObservation] else {
        throw NSError(domain: "FaceDetectionError", code: -2, userInfo: nil)
    }
    
    return faceObservations
}
```

In this example, we define a `detectFaces` function that takes an input image and returns an array of `VNFaceObservation` objects. Inside the function, we convert the input image to a `CIImage` and create a face detection request. We then perform the face detection request using `await` to wait for the results.

## Handling Errors with `async/await`

In the previous example, we used the `throws` keyword to indicate that our `detectFaces` function can throw an error. When working with asynchronous code, it's important to handle any potential errors that may occur. We can use `try await` to catch and handle errors inside an `async` function.

```swift
do {
    let faceObservations = try await detectFaces(in: image)
    // Process face observations
} catch {
    // Handle error
}
```

Here, we wrap the `try await` statement inside a `do-catch` block, allowing us to catch any errors thrown by the asynchronous function.

## Conclusion

Using `async/await` with Machine Vision in Swift allows us to write cleaner and more readable code when dealing with asynchronous tasks. It simplifies the process of handling asynchronous operations, eliminates callback hell, and promotes a more sequential programming style. By leveraging the power of `async/await`, we can build powerful image analysis functionalities in our apps with ease.
