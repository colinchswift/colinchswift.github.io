Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a popular service for sending push notifications to mobile devices. With the introduction of Swift 5.5, you can now use `async/await` syntax to write more concise and readable code when working with asynchronous tasks. In this blog post, we will explore how to use `async/await` with FCM in Swift.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following set up:

- Xcode installed
- A Firebase project with FCM enabled

## Setting up Firebase

To get started, follow these steps to set up Firebase in your Swift project:

1. Install the Firebase SDK by adding the dependency to your project. You can do this using CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager. Refer to the official Firebase documentation for more details.

2. Import the Firebase module in your Swift file:

```swift
import Firebase
```

3. Configure Firebase in your app delegate's `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    FirebaseApp.configure()
    return true
}
```

## Sending a push notification

Now that Firebase is set up, let's see how we can use `async/await` to send a push notification using FCM. Here's an example implementation:

```swift
import FirebaseMessaging

// Set up a custom function to send a push notification
func sendPushNotification(to token: String, title: String, body: String) async throws {
    let message = Messaging.messaging().createMessage {
        $0.token = token
        $0.notification = MessagingNotification(title: title, body: body)
    }
    
    do {
        try await Messaging.messaging().send(message)
        print("Push notification sent successfully")
    } catch {
        print("Failed to send push notification: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```

In this example, we use the `sendPushNotification` function to send a push notification to a device identified by its FCM token. The function takes three parameters: the device token, the notification title, and the notification body.

We use the `createMessage` method of `Messaging.messaging()` to create a new FCM message and set the desired title and body for the notification. The message is then sent using the `send` method, which is awaited using the `await` keyword.

If the push notification is sent successfully, we print a success message. Otherwise, we print an error message with the error description.

## Calling the `sendPushNotification` function

To send a push notification, you can call the `sendPushNotification` function with the appropriate parameters. Here's an example usage:

```swift
do {
    try await sendPushNotification(to: "DEVICE_TOKEN", title: "New Message", body: "You have a new message")
} catch {
    print("Failed to send push notification: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

Replace `"DEVICE_TOKEN"` with the actual FCM token of the device you want to send the push notification to. If the push notification fails to send, an error message will be printed.

## Conclusion

Using `async/await` syntax with Firebase Cloud Messaging in Swift allows you to write asynchronous code in a more readable and concise manner. With just a few lines of code, you can send push notifications to mobile devices with ease.

Remember to handle error cases and ensure that your Firebase project is properly configured for FCM. Feel free to explore the Firebase documentation for more advanced features and customization options.
