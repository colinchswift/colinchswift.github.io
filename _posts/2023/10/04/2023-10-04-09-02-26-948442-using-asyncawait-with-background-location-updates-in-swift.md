## Introduction

Background location updates are essential for many location-based applications. Traditionally, this feature is implemented using delegate methods or completion handlers, which can make the code difficult to read and maintain. However, with the introduction of `async/await` in Swift, handling asynchronous operations becomes much simpler and more elegant.

## Getting Started

To get started, create a new Swift project in Xcode and import the necessary frameworks for handling location updates, such as `CoreLocation`.

## Implementing Background Location Updates

Before we dive into using `async/await`, let's first implement the basic functionality for background location updates. Start by setting up the location manager and requesting the necessary permissions from the user. Make sure to add the necessary usage descriptions in your `Info.plist` file.

```swift
import CoreLocation

let locationManager = CLLocationManager()

func requestLocationUpdates() {
    locationManager.delegate = self
    locationManager.distanceFilter = kCLDistanceFilterNone
    locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBest
    locationManager.allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates = true
    locationManager.requestAlwaysAuthorization()
    locationManager.startUpdatingLocation()
}
```

## Handling Location Updates using async/await

Now, utilizing the `async/await` pattern, we can further simplify the code and make it more intuitive. To do this, we can leverage the power of Swift's concurrency system and the `CLLocationManagerDelegate` methods.

```swift
extension CLLocationManager {
    func locationUpdates() async throws -> CLLocation {
        return try await withCheckedThrowingContinuation { continuation in
            self.delegate = self
            self.startUpdatingLocation()
            
            self.locationUpdateContinuation = continuation
        }
    }
    
    func stopLocationUpdates() {
        self.stopUpdatingLocation()
    }
}

extension CLLocationManager: CLLocationManagerDelegate {
    func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) {
        if let location = locations.last,
           let continuation = self.locationUpdateContinuation {
            continuation.resume(returning: location)
            self.locationUpdateContinuation = nil
        }
    }
    
    func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didFailWithError error: Error) {
        if let continuation = self.locationUpdateContinuation {
            continuation.resume(throwing: error)
            self.locationUpdateContinuation = nil
        }
    }
}
```

In the example above, we extend the `CLLocationManager` class to add new methods for starting, stopping, and handling location updates using `async/await`. We utilize the `withCheckedThrowingContinuation` method to suspend the execution of the function and resume it with either a value or an error when a location update is available.

To use this new pattern, simply call the `locationUpdates()` method to start receiving location updates asynchronously.

```swift
do {
    let location = try await locationManager.locationUpdates()
    // Use the received location in your application
} catch {
    // Handle any errors that occurred during location updates
}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to utilize the `async/await` pattern in Swift for handling background location updates. By using `async/await`, we were able to simplify the code and make it more readable. This pattern helps eliminate complex callbacks and completion handlers, resulting in more straightforward and maintainable code.

By incorporating `async/await` into your Swift projects, you can make your asynchronous code more elegant and easier to work with. So go ahead and start taking advantage of this powerful pattern in your location-based applications!
