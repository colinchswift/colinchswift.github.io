Swift 5.5 introduced async/await as a new way of writing asynchronous code. With async/await, you can write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code, making it easier to understand and maintain.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement async/await in a REST API client in Swift, leveraging the power of URLSession. We will make use of the `URLSessionDataTask` class to perform asynchronous network requests.

## Setting up the project

Before we dive into implementing async/await, let's set up a basic project structure and create a network service class.

1. Create a new Swift project in Xcode.
2. Create a new Swift file called `NetworkService.swift`.
3. Add the following code to the `NetworkService.swift` file:

```swift
import Foundation

class NetworkService {
    
    let session: URLSession
    
    init() {
        session = URLSession.shared
    }
    
    func sendRequest(url: URL) async throws -> (Data, URLResponse) {
        let (data, response) = try await session.data(from: url)
        return (data, response)
    }
}
```

In the above code, we define a `NetworkService` class with a `sendRequest(url:)` method. This method performs an asynchronous network request using `URLSession` and returns the received data and response.

## Implementing async/await

To enable async/await in your Swift project, you need to make a few changes.

1. Update the project deployment target to iOS 15 or higher.
2. Add `@available(iOS 15.0, *)` attribute to the class where you want to use async/await.
3. Add `async` keyword before the function that you want to make asynchronous.
4. Add `throws` keyword to indicate that the function may throw an error.

## Making API requests

Now let's see how we can use the `NetworkService` class to make API requests using async/await.

```swift
@available(iOS 15.0, *)
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
    let networkService = NetworkService()
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        Task {
            do {
                let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/data")!
                let (data, response) = try await networkService.sendRequest(url: url)
                // Handle the received data and response here
            } catch {
                // Handle the error
            }
        }
        
    }
}
```

In the above code, we create an instance of `NetworkService` and call the `sendRequest(url:)` method inside a `Task` block. The `Task` block allows us to use `await` to wait for the asynchronous operation to complete. If an error occurs, we catch it and handle it accordingly.

## Handling errors

When using async/await, it's important to handle errors properly. You can use a `do-catch` block to catch and handle errors that occur during the asynchronous operation.

```swift
do {
    let (data, response) = try await networkService.sendRequest(url: url)
    // Handle the received data and response here
} catch {
    // Handle the error
}
```

By using `try await`, you can propagate any errors that occur within the asynchronous operation to the caller. This allows for better error handling and makes it easier to reason about the flow of your code.

## Conclusion

Async/await is a powerful new feature in Swift that makes writing asynchronous code much easier and more readable. In this blog post, we explored how to implement async/await in a REST API client in Swift using URLSession. We also covered how to make API requests and handle errors using async/await.

By leveraging async/await, you can write more maintainable and efficient code, making it easier to work with asynchronous operations in Swift. So give async/await a try and see how it can improve your code! #Swift #AsyncAwait
