In modern asynchronous programming, **async/await** has become a popular approach for handling asynchronous operations. With the introduction of Swift 5.5, iOS developers can now leverage async/await to write cleaner and more readable code when working with asynchronous tasks.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use async/await in Swift to synchronize data from different sources in a concurrent and efficient manner.

## Introduction to async/await

**Async/await** is a language feature that allows developers to write asynchronous code in a more sequential and synchronous style. It improves readability and reduces the complexity of handling asynchronous tasks, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations.

Using `async`, you can mark a function as asynchronous, and within that function, you can `await` the result of another asynchronous task. The `await` keyword suspends the execution of the current task until the awaited task completes.

## Synchronizing data from multiple sources

Let's say we have two data sources, `DataSource1` and `DataSource2`, that provide data asynchronously. We want to fetch data from both sources and perform some operations on the combined data.

Using async/await, we can write a function that synchronizes the data from both sources as follows:

```swift
func syncData() async throws -> [Data] {
    let data1 = try await DataSource1.fetchData()
    let data2 = try await DataSource2.fetchData()

    // Combine the data and perform operations
    let combinedData = data1 + data2
    let processedData = await process(combinedData)

    return processedData
}
```

In the above code, `fetchData()` functions of `DataSource1` and `DataSource2` are marked as `async` to indicate that they return a `Task` representing an asynchronous operation. By using `await` to call these functions, we can wait for the data to be fetched and safely handle any errors that may occur during the asynchronous operations.

The `syncData()` function then combines the data fetched from both sources, performs some operations on the combined data using the `process()` function, and returns the processed data.

## Example code

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates using async/await to synchronize data from different sources:

**AsyncDataSource.swift**

```swift
struct AsyncDataSource {
    static func fetchData() async throws -> [Data] {
        // Simulate async fetching of data
        await Task.sleep(1 * 1_000_000_000) // Sleep for 1 second
        return [Data]()
    }
}

struct Data { /* Define your Data model here */ }

```

**DataSync.swift**

```swift
class DataSync {
    func syncData() async throws -> [Data] {
        let data1 = try await AsyncDataSource.fetchData()
        let data2 = try await AsyncDataSource.fetchData()

        // Combine the data and perform operations
        let combinedData = data1 + data2
        let processedData = await process(combinedData)

        return processedData
    }

    private func process(_ data: [Data]) async -> [Data] {
        // Perform data processing asynchronously
        return data
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Using async/await in Swift simplifies the handling of asynchronous tasks, especially when synchronizing data from multiple sources. With the ability to write asynchronous code in a familiar and sequential style, developers can produce cleaner and more maintainable code.

By leveraging async/await, you can ensure that your code efficiently waits for asynchronous operations to complete before proceeding, enabling you to synchronize and process data from multiple sources seamlessly.
