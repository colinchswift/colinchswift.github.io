Core Location is a powerful framework in Swift that allows you to work with location-based services on iOS devices. With the introduction of Swift 5.5, you can now use `async/await` to write asynchronous code in a more readable and efficient way. In this blog post, we'll explore how to use `async/await` with Core Location to retrieve the user's current location.

## Getting Started with `async/await`

Before we dive into using `async/await` with Core Location, let's first understand how `async/await` works in Swift. `async/await` is a language feature that allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and works like synchronous code. It provides a more concise syntax and improves readability of your code.

To start using `async/await`, you need to have Swift 5.5 or newer and iOS 15 or newer. You can update your project's Swift version in Xcode by going to **Build Settings** > **Swift Compiler - Language** > **Swift Language Version** and selecting the desired version.

## Using `async/await` with Core Location

To use `async/await` with Core Location, we need to create an instance of the `CLLocationManager` class, which is responsible for managing location-related services. We can then use the `CLLocationManagerDelegate` methods to handle the asynchronous callbacks.

Here's an example of how to use `async/await` with Core Location to retrieve the user's current location:

```swift
import CoreLocation

func getCurrentLocation() async throws -> CLLocation {
    let locationManager = CLLocationManager()
    let locationPermissionStatus = await locationManager.requestWhenInUseAuthorization()

    if locationPermissionStatus == .authorizedWhenInUse {
        return await withCheckedThrowingContinuation { continuation in
            locationManager.delegate = MyLocationDelegate(continuation: continuation)
            locationManager.startUpdatingLocation()
        }
    } else {
        throw LocationError.permissionDenied
    }
}

class MyLocationDelegate: NSObject, CLLocationManagerDelegate {
    let continuation: CheckedContinuation<CLLocation, Error>

    init(continuation: CheckedContinuation<CLLocation, Error>) {
        self.continuation = continuation
    }

    func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) {
        if let location = locations.first {
            continuation.resume(returning: location)
        }
        manager.stopUpdatingLocation()
    }

    func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didFailWithError error: Error) {
        continuation.resume(throwing: error)
        manager.stopUpdatingLocation()
    }
}

enum LocationError: Error {
    case permissionDenied
}
```

In this example, we create a function `getCurrentLocation` that returns a `CLLocation` object. Inside the function, we initialize a `CLLocationManager` instance and request the user's permission to access their location. If the permission is granted, we use `withCheckedThrowingContinuation` to create a continuation that captures the `CLLocation` object when it becomes available.

We also define a custom `CLLocationManagerDelegate` class `MyLocationDelegate` to handle the asynchronous callbacks. When the location gets updated, we resume the continuation with the retrieved location. If an error occurs during the location retrieval process, we resume the continuation with the thrown error.

## Conclusion

Using `async/await` with Core Location in Swift allows you to write asynchronous code in a more concise and readable manner. By leveraging the power of `async/await`, you can easily retrieve the user's current location without dealing with complex callback mechanisms. Give it a try and see how it enhances your location-based services in your iOS applications.
