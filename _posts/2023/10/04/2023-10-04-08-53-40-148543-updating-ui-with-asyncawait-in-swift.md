Asynchronous programming is an essential part of modern app development. It allows for non-blocking execution, ensuring a smooth user experience while performing time-consuming tasks. In Swift, the traditional approach of using completion handlers and callbacks can lead to complex and unreadable code.

Fortunately, with the introduction of Swift 5.5, we now have native support for `async/await` syntax. It simplifies asynchronous code and makes it more readable and maintainable. In this blog post, we'll explore how to update the user interface using the `async/await` pattern in Swift.

## Introduction to `async/await`

`async/await` is a language feature that allows you to write asynchronous code in a more sequential and transparent manner. It enables you to pause the execution of a function until a specific asynchronous task completes, without blocking the main thread.

The `async` keyword is used to mark a function as asynchronous, indicating that it may contain `await` expressions. An `await` expression suspends the execution of the current function until the awaited task is complete. This allows for easier readability and eliminates the need for nested completion handlers.

## Updating UI with `async/await`

Let's consider a scenario where we need to fetch some data from a network API and update the UI with the fetched data. Traditionally, we would use completion handlers to handle the asynchronous nature of the network request. Here's an example of how it might look:

```swift
func fetchData(completion: @escaping (Result<Data, Error>) -> Void) {
    // Make asynchronous network request
    // Call completion handler with result
}

func updateUI() {
    fetchData { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let data):
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                // Update UI with data
            }
        case .failure(let error):
            // Handle error
        }
    }
}
```

With `async/await`, we can rewrite the code in a more sequential and readable manner:

```swift
func fetchData() async throws -> Data {
    // Make asynchronous network request
    // Return the fetched data
}

func updateUI() async {
    do {
        let data = try await fetchData()
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            // Update UI with data
        }
    } catch {
        // Handle error
    }
}
```

In the `updateUI()` function, we mark it as `async` to indicate that it contains `await` expressions. We can now call `fetchData()` using `await` to pause the execution until the data is fetched. Once we have the data, we update the UI on the main queue using `DispatchQueue.main.async`.

## Error Handling with `async/await`

When using `async/await`, we can use the `throws` keyword to propagate errors from asynchronous functions. By doing this, we can handle errors using a conventional `try-catch` block.

```swift
func fetchData() async throws -> Data {
    // Make asynchronous network request
    // Return the fetched data or throw an error
}

func updateUI() async {
    do {
        let data = try await fetchData()
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            // Update UI with data
        }
    } catch {
        // Handle error
    }
}
```

By handling errors in a familiar way with `try-catch`, it improves the overall code readability and error handling experience.

## Conclusion

Using `async/await` in Swift greatly simplifies asynchronous code, making it more readable and maintainable. By updating the UI with `async/await`, we can ensure a smoother user experience, as time-consuming tasks are executed asynchronously without blocking the main thread.

With Swift 5.5's native support for `async/await`, it's now easier than ever to write clean and efficient asynchronous code. So go ahead and embrace `async/await` in your next Swift project and experience the benefits firsthand!
