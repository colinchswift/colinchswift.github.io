Core ML is a powerful framework provided by Apple that allows developers to integrate machine learning models into their iOS apps. With the release of Swift 5.5, the language introduced the async/await pattern, making asynchronous programming even easier. In this blog post, we will explore how to use async/await with Core ML in Swift.

## Prerequisites

To follow along, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Xcode 13 or later
- Swift 5.5 or later
- A Core ML model

## Adding the Core ML model to your project

Start by adding the Core ML model to your Xcode project. Simply drag and drop the `.mlmodel` file into your project's file navigator. Xcode will take care of generating the necessary code to interact with the model.

## Converting the Core ML model to a Swift function

Once you have added the Core ML model to your project, Xcode will generate a Swift class representing the model. You can convert this class into an `async` function using the `Task.detached` function.

Here's an example of converting a Core ML model into an asynchronous function:

```swift
import CoreML

func predict(input: MyInputType) async throws -> MyOutputType {
    let model = try await Task.detached {
        return try MyModel().model
    }
    
    let prediction = try await model.prediction(input: input)
    return prediction.output
}
```

Note the usage of `async` and `await` keywords. The `Task.detached` function is used to perform the loading of the model asynchronously. The `await` keyword is used to wait for the completion of the model loading.

## Using the async function

To use the async function, simply call it like any other asynchronous function. You can use the `await` keyword to wait for the prediction result.

Here's an example of using the async function:

```swift
let input: MyInputType = // Provide input data

do {
    let prediction = try await predict(input: input)
    // Use the prediction result
} catch {
    // Handle any errors
}
```

## Conclusion

Using async/await with Core ML in Swift allows you to seamlessly integrate machine learning into your iOS apps. The improved syntax provided by Swift 5.5 makes asynchronous programming more concise and readable. By converting Core ML models into async functions, you can harness the power of modern Swift concurrency features. Happy coding!
