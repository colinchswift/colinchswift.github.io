Augmented reality (AR) has become an increasingly popular technology in recent years, allowing developers to create immersive and interactive experiences. In Swift, the async/await feature introduced in Swift 5.5 can greatly simplify working with asynchronous operations in AR applications. In this tutorial, we will explore how to leverage async/await to streamline AR development in Swift.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Xcode 13 (or later) installed on your computer.
2. Basic knowledge of Swift programming.

Now let's dive into the code!

## Setting Up the Project

To get started, create a new Swift project in Xcode and import the ARKit framework. Open `ViewController.swift` and add the following code:

```swift
import ARKit

class ViewController: UIViewController, ARSCNViewDelegate {

    @IBOutlet var sceneView: ARSCNView!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        sceneView.delegate = self

        let configuration = ARWorldTrackingConfiguration()
        sceneView.session.run(configuration)
    }

    // Implement ARSCNViewDelegate methods here...

}
```

This sets up a basic AR scene with an `ARSCNView` and runs the AR session using a `ARWorldTrackingConfiguration`.

## Async/Await in ARKit

Now let's see how async/await can simplify working with ARKit's asynchronous APIs. Suppose you want to load a 3D model onto a detected AR plane and interact with it. Traditionally, you would have to use the completion handler pattern or delegates to handle asynchronous operations. However, with async/await, you can write more synchronous-looking code.

Add the following method to the `ViewController` class:

```swift
func loadModelAsync() async throws -> SCNNode {
    let modelUrl = // URL of the 3D model

    do {
        let scene = try await SCNScene(url: modelUrl, options: nil)
        let node = SCNNode()
        for child in scene.rootNode.childNodes {
            node.addChildNode(child)
        }
        return node
    } catch {
        throw error
    }
}
```

In this code, we define the `loadModelAsync` method with the `async` keyword, indicating that it can be used with `await` to perform asynchronous operations. The method attempts to load a 3D model from a given URL, and if successful, creates an `SCNNode` to hold the model's contents.

Next, let's update the `ViewController` class to detect AR planes and add the 3D model on each detected plane:

```swift
func renderer(_ renderer: SCNSceneRenderer, didAdd node: SCNNode, for anchor: ARAnchor) {
    guard let planeAnchor = anchor as? ARPlaneAnchor else { return }

    async {
        do {
            let modelNode = try await self.loadModelAsync()
            modelNode.position = SCNVector3(planeAnchor.center.x, planeAnchor.center.y, planeAnchor.center.z)
            node.addChildNode(modelNode)
        } catch {
            print("Error loading 3D model:", error.localizedDescription)
        }
    }
}
```

In the `renderer(_:didAdd:for:)` method, which is called whenever ARKit detects a new plane, we use the `async` keyword to define an asynchronous closure. Inside this closure, we use `await` to call the `loadModelAsync` method and add the loaded model to the detected plane's `SCNNode` after adjusting its position.

## Conclusion

Using async/await with augmented reality in Swift can help simplify code and make it more readable when working with ARKit's asynchronous APIs. It allows you to write code that looks synchronous while leveraging the power of asynchronous programming. Take advantage of this powerful feature to enhance your AR experiences in Swift!
