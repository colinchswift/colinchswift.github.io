With the introduction of Swift 5.5, Apple has added support for `async/await`, a powerful new feature for working with asynchronous code. Using `async/await` can simplify and streamline your asynchronous code, making it easier to read, write, and reason about. In this blog post, we'll explore some best practices for using `async/await` in Swift.

## 1. Designing Asynchronous Functions

When designing asynchronous functions in Swift, aim for clarity and consistency in your API design. Here are some guidelines to follow:

### a. Use the `async` keyword

Use the `async` keyword to mark functions that perform asynchronous operations. This makes it explicit that the function is asynchronous and can be awaited.

### b. Return `Task` or `Task<T>`

Use the `Task` type to represent async operations that don't return a value, and `Task<T>` for async operations that return a value of type `T`. This provides a clear and consistent way to handle async operations.

### c. Limit the use of throwing async functions

Avoid using throwing async functions, as they can lead to confusion and make error handling more complex. Instead, consider using the `Result` type to handle errors.

### d. Document the expected behavior

Document the expected behavior of your async functions, especially any potential side effects or thread safety considerations. This can help consumers of your API understand how to use the functions correctly.

## 2. Handling Errors

When working with `async/await`, it's important to handle errors effectively. Here are some best practices for error handling:

### a. Use `do/catch` for error handling

`async/await` doesn't change the way errors are handled in Swift. You should still use `do/catch` blocks to handle and propagate errors.

### b. Use `try/await`

When calling an async function that can throw an error, use `try/await` to properly handle the error. This ensures that the error is correctly propagated up the call stack.

### c. Consider using the `Result` type

If an async function can fail, consider using the `Result` type to provide a clear and explicit way to handle errors. This can make error handling code more readable and maintainable.

## 3. Concurrency Considerations

`async/await` is built on top of Swift's new concurrency model, which introduces structured concurrency. Here are some concurrency considerations to keep in mind:

### a. Think in terms of tasks

With `async/await`, you can work with tasks, which represent units of work. Think in terms of tasks and orchestrate their execution using techniques like `async let` and `Task.withGroup`.

### b. Avoid blocking the main thread

Asynchronous code should not block the main thread, as it can lead to unresponsive user interfaces. Use `await` in conjunction with `Task { }` to ensure that async code doesn't block the main thread.

### c. Consider using structured concurrency

Structured concurrency helps manage the lifecycle of tasks and ensures that all tasks are complete before continuing. Embrace structured concurrency to avoid resource leaks and make code more robust.

## Conclusion

Using `async/await` in Swift can greatly improve the readability and maintainability of asynchronous code. By following the best practices outlined in this article, you can write clean and efficient asynchronous code that is easier to reason about and maintain.
