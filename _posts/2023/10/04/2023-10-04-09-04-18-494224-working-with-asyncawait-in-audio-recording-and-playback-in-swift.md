## Introduction
In modern Swift development, the `async/await` pattern has become an essential part of writing asynchronous code. This allows developers to write cleaner and more readable code when dealing with asynchronous tasks, such as audio recording and playback. In this article, we will explore how to leverage the `async/await` pattern to work with audio recording and playback in Swift.

## Recording Audio asynchronously
To start recording audio asynchronously in Swift, we can utilize the `AVFoundation` framework. Here's an example of how to record audio using the `async/await` pattern:

```swift
import AVFoundation

func startAudioRecording() async throws -> URL {
    let session = AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()
    try await session.setCategory(.record)
    try await session.setActive(true)
    
    let recordingSettings: [String: Any] = [
        AVFormatIDKey: kAudioFormatMPEG4AAC,
        AVEncoderAudioQualityKey: AVAudioQuality.high.rawValue,
        AVEncoderBitRateKey: 320000,
        AVNumberOfChannelsKey: 2,
        AVSampleRateKey: 44100.0
    ]

    let fileURL = // your desired file URL to save the recording
    let audioRecorder = try AVAudioRecorder(url: fileURL, settings: recordingSettings)
    audioRecorder.prepareToRecord()
    audioRecorder.record()
    
    return fileURL
}
```
In the above code, we use the `AVAudioSession` to set the category and activate the session for recording. Then, we set up the recording settings, create an instance of `AVAudioRecorder`, and start recording by calling the `record()` method. Finally, we return the file URL of the recorded audio.

## Playing Audio asynchronously
To play audio asynchronously in Swift, we can again leverage the `AVFoundation` framework. Here's an example of how to play audio using the `async/await` pattern:

```swift
import AVFoundation

func playAudio(fileURL: URL) async throws {
    let audioPlayer = try AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: fileURL)
    try await audioPlayer.prepareToPlay()
    audioPlayer.play()
    
    await Task.sleep(5 * 1000000000) // play for 5 seconds
    
    audioPlayer.stop()
}
```

In the above code, we use `AVAudioPlayer` to create an instance with the specified file URL. Then, we call `prepareToPlay()` to prepare the audio player for playback, followed by calling `play()` to start playing the audio. To play the audio for a specific duration, we can use `Task.sleep()` with the desired duration in nanoseconds. Finally, we call `stop()` to stop playback.

## Conclusion
Using the `async/await` pattern in Swift allows us to write cleaner and more readable code when working with asynchronous tasks like audio recording and playback. By leveraging the power of the `AVFoundation` framework, we can easily integrate audio functionality into our Swift applications. So, go ahead and experiment with async/await to make your audio recording and playback experiences smoother and more efficient.
