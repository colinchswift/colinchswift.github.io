## Introduction

In the world of asynchronous programming, Swift language has introduced the concept of `async`/`await` to make writing and handling asynchronous code more straightforward and readable. With the release of Swift 5.5, developers can now use `async`/`await` to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous style.

In this blog post, we will explore how to enable `async`/`await` in Swift and take a look at the benefits it brings to asynchronous programming.

## What is Async/Await?

`async`/`await` is a programming pattern that allows developers to write asynchronous code in a more sequential and intuitive manner. Traditionally, asynchronous operations in Swift were implemented using completion handlers or delegates, leading to callback hell and hard-to-read code.

With `async`/`await`, you can write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code, making it easier to reason about and maintain. 

## Enabling Async/Await in Swift

To enable `async`/`await` in Swift, you need to have a minimum version of Swift 5.5 or later. If you're using an earlier version, you will need to update your Swift version.

Once you have the appropriate Swift version, you can enable `async`/`await` in your code by adding the `async` keyword to functions and using the `await` keyword to await the result of an asynchronous operation.

```swift
@available(iOS 15.0, *)
func fetchData() async throws -> Data {
    let url = URL(string: "https://example.com/api/data")!
    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
    return data
}
```

In the above example, the `fetchData()` function is marked as `async` and can be awaited. The `data(from:)` method of URLSession is also marked as `async`, denoting it can be awaited.

## Using Async/Await

Once you have enabled `async`/`await` in your code, you can use it to write asynchronous code in a more sequential and readable manner. Here's an example of how you can use `async`/`await` to fetch data from an API and update the UI:

```swift
@available(iOS 15.0, *)
func fetchAndDisplayData() async {
    do {
        let data = try await fetchData()
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            // Update UI with fetched data
        }
    } catch {
        // Handle error
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `fetchAndDisplayData()` function is marked as `async`. It calls the `fetchData()` function using the `await` keyword to wait for the asynchronous operation to complete. Once the data is fetched, it updates the UI on the main queue using `DispatchQueue.main.async`.

## Benefits of Async/Await

Using `async`/`await` in your Swift code brings several benefits:

1. **Readability:** Asynchronous code written using `async`/`await` is more readable and easier to understand compared to traditional callback-based code.
2. **Simplicity:** The `async`/`await` pattern simplifies the flow of asynchronous code, making it more straightforward to write and reason about.
3. **Error Handling:** `async`/`await` provides a more natural way to handle errors using the standard Swift error handling mechanism.
4. **Integration:** `async`/`await` integrates well with existing Swift codebases, allowing you to incrementally adopt asynchronous programming patterns.

## Conclusion

Enabling `async`/`await` in Swift opens up new possibilities for writing clean and concise asynchronous code. It improves the readability and maintainability of your codebase while making it easier to handle asynchronous operations.

With the release of Swift 5.5, you have the tools at your disposal to write asynchronous code that looks and feels like synchronous code, providing a more intuitive programming experience.

By adopting `async`/`await`, you can take advantage of the benefits it offers and take your Swift code to the next level of asynchronous programming.
