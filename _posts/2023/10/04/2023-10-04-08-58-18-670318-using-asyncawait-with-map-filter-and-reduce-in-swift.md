In Swift, `async`/`await` is a powerful feature that allows you to write asynchronous code in a more readable and sequential manner. It simplifies handling asynchronous tasks by avoiding callbacks and using a more synchronous style of programming. In this blog post, we will explore how to use `async`/`await` with the `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` higher-order functions in Swift.

## What is async/await?

Async/await is a language feature that allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code. It is built on top of Swift's concurrency model introduced in Swift 5.5. By using the `async` keyword before a function declaration and the `await` keyword before an asynchronous function call, you can write asynchronous code in a more sequential and readable way.

## Using async/await with map

In Swift, the `map` function is commonly used to transform elements in an array. When using `async`/`await` with `map`, you can transform elements asynchronously and await the completion of each transformation before moving to the next element. Let's take a look at an example:

```swift
func asyncMapExample() async throws -> [String] {
    let urls = ["https://example.com", "https://google.com", "https://apple.com"]
    
    let transformedResults = try await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: String.self) { group in
        return try await group.map { url in
            let data = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: URL(string: url)!)
            return String(data: data.0, encoding: .utf8)!
        }
    }
    
    return transformedResults
}
```
In this example, we have an array of URLs that we want to fetch data from asynchronously and transform into strings. By using `withThrowingTaskGroup`, we create a group of tasks that will run concurrently. The `map` function allows us to transform the array of URLs into an array of transformed results asynchronously. We use `await` to wait for each transformation to complete before moving to the next URL.

## Using async/await with filter

In Swift, the `filter` function allows you to filter elements in an array based on a given condition. When using `async`/`await` with `filter`, you can filter elements asynchronously based on an asynchronous condition. Here's an example:

```swift
func asyncFilterExample() async -> [Int] {
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    
    let filteredResults = await withTaskGroup(of: Int.self) { group -> [Int] in
        for number in numbers {
            await group.addTask { () -> Int in
                // Use an asynchronous condition here
                if await isEven(number) {
                    return number
                }
                return 0
            }
        }
        
        var results = [Int]()
        for try await result in group {
            if result != 0 {
                results.append(result)
            }
        }
        
        return results
    }
    
    return filteredResults
}

func isEven(_ number: Int) async -> Bool {
    // Simulating an asynchronous operation
    await Task.sleep(100_000_000)
    
    return number % 2 == 0
}
```
In this example, we have an array of numbers and we want to filter out the even numbers asynchronously. We use `withTaskGroup` to create a group of tasks and add each number to the group. Each task then asynchronously checks if the number is even using the `isEven` function. Finally, we iterate over the results of the group, filter out the numbers that are equal to 0, and return the filtered results.

## Using async/await with reduce

In Swift, the `reduce` function is useful for combining elements in an array into a single value. When using `async`/`await` with `reduce`, you can combine elements asynchronously and await the completion of each combination before moving to the next element. Here's an example:

```swift
func asyncReduceExample() async -> Int {
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    
    let reducedResult = await withTaskGroup(of: Int.self, reduction: +) { group in
        return try await group.reduce(0) { partialResult, number in
            let transformedValue = await transform(number)
            return partialResult + transformedValue
        }
    }
    
    return reducedResult
}

func transform(_ number: Int) async -> Int {
    // Simulating an asynchronous operation
    await Task.sleep(100_000_000)
    
    return number * 2
}
```

In this example, we have an array of numbers, and we want to asynchronously multiply each number by two and combine them together using `reduce`. We use `withTaskGroup` to create a group of tasks, and then use `reduce` to combine the transformed values asynchronously. The `reduction` parameter in `withTaskGroup` specifies the combining operation, in this case, addition `+`. Finally, we return the reduced result.

## Conclusion

By using `async`/`await` with higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`, you can write asynchronous code in a more sequential and readable manner. This makes it easier to handle asynchronous tasks in Swift applications. The examples provided in this blog post demonstrate how to leverage `async`/`await` with these higher-order functions to perform tasks asynchronously and await the completion of each task before moving on.
