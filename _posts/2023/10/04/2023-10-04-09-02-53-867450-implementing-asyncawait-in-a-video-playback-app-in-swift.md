In this blog post, we will explore how to implement `async`/`await` functionality in a video playback app using Swift. `async`/`await` is a powerful feature introduced in Swift 5.5 that allows for writing asynchronous code in a more readable and concise way.

## Introduction to async/await

`async`/`await` is a way to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code. It allows developers to write asynchronous functions that can be paused and resumed at `await` points until the awaited asynchronous operation completes. This makes code easier to read and write without the need for callbacks or completion handlers.

## Setting up the video playback app

Let's start by setting up a basic video playback app. We'll use the `AVPlayer` class from the `AVFoundation` framework for video playback. Here's a simplified version of the app:

```swift
import AVFoundation

class VideoPlayer {
    private var player: AVPlayer

    init() {
        player = AVPlayer()
    }

    func playVideo(at url: URL) {
        let playerItem = AVPlayerItem(url: url)
        player.replaceCurrentItem(with: playerItem)
        player.play()
    }
}
```

## Implementing async/await for video loading

Now let's enhance our video playback app to support `async`/`await` for video loading. We'll create an asynchronous version of the `playVideo(at:)` function that allows us to `await` the video loading before playing it. Here's an updated version of the `VideoPlayer` class:

```swift
class AsyncVideoPlayer {
    private var player: AVPlayer

    init() {
        player = AVPlayer()
    }

    // Asynchronously load the video and return a promise
    func loadVideo(at url: URL) async -> Bool {
        let playerItem = AVPlayerItem(url: url)

        return await withCheckedContinuation { continuation in
            player.replaceCurrentItem(with: playerItem)

            player.currentItem?.observe(\.status) { item, _ in
                if item.status == .readyToPlay {
                    continuation.resume(returning: true)
                } else {
                    continuation.resume(returning: false)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the `loadVideo(at:)` function, we create a `Promise` using `withCheckedContinuation`, which allows us to asynchronously wait for the video to load. We observe the `status` property of the `AVPlayerItem` to determine when the video is ready to play, and then resume the `continuation` with the appropriate value.

## Using async/await for video playback

With our `AsyncVideoPlayer` class in place, we can now use `async`/`await` to load and play videos in our app. Here's an example:

```swift
let videoPlayer = AsyncVideoPlayer()
let videoURL = URL(string: "https://example.com/video.mp4")!

Task {
    let loaded = await videoPlayer.loadVideo(at: videoURL)

    if loaded {
        print("Video loaded successfully")
        videoPlayer.play()
    } else {
        print("Failed to load video")
    }
}
```

In the example above, we create an instance of `AsyncVideoPlayer` and specify the URL of the video we want to play. We use `await` to wait for the video to load, and then check if it loaded successfully before calling the `play()` function.

## Conclusion

`async`/`await` is a powerful feature in Swift that allows for writing asynchronous code in a more readable and concise way. In this blog post, we demonstrated how to implement `async`/`await` in a video playback app using Swift. This makes video loading and playback smoother and more efficient, providing a better user experience.
