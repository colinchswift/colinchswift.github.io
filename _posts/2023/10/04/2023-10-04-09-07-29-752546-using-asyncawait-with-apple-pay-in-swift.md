When working with Apple Pay in Swift, you may need to make asynchronous calls to perform various operations. With the introduction of async/await in Swift 5.5, handling asynchronous tasks has become easier and more readable. In this blog post, we will explore how to use async/await with Apple Pay in Swift.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into using async/await with Apple Pay, make sure you have the following:

- Xcode 13 or later
- An Apple Developer account
- A device with Apple Pay capabilities

## Setting up Apple Pay

To begin, you need to set up Apple Pay in your project. Open your project in Xcode and follow these steps:

1. Go to your project target's settings.
2. Navigate to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab.
3. Click the "+" button to add a new capability.
4. Search for "Apple Pay" and enable it.

## Using async/await with Apple Pay

1. Import the necessary frameworks:

```swift
import PassKit
import CryptoKit
import Contacts
```

2. Implement the `PKPaymentAuthorizationViewControllerDelegate` protocol in your view controller:

```swift
class PaymentViewController: UIViewController, PKPaymentAuthorizationViewControllerDelegate {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

3. Add a function to handle the Apple Pay payment request:

```swift
extension PaymentViewController {
    func handlePaymentRequest() async {
        // Create a PKPaymentRequest
        let paymentRequest = PKPaymentRequest()
        
        // Configure the payment request with merchant, currency, and payment summary
        paymentRequest.merchantIdentifier = "your_merchant_identifier"
        paymentRequest.countryCode = "US"
        paymentRequest.currencyCode = "USD"
        paymentRequest.supportedNetworks = [.visa, .masterCard, .amex]
        paymentRequest.merchantCapabilities = .capability3DS
        
        let paymentSummaryItem = PKPaymentSummaryItem(label: "Item", amount: NSDecimalNumber(string: "10.00"))
        paymentRequest.paymentSummaryItems = [paymentSummaryItem]
        
        // Create a PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController
        let paymentAuthorizationViewController = PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController(paymentRequest: paymentRequest)
        paymentAuthorizationViewController.delegate = self
        
        do {
            // Present the PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController
            let result = try await self.present(paymentAuthorizationViewController, animated: true)
            
            // Handle the result
            // ...
        } catch {
            // Handle error
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

4. Implement the `paymentAuthorizationViewController(_:didAuthorizePayment:handler:)` method delegate:

```swift
extension PaymentViewController {
    func paymentAuthorizationViewController(_ controller: PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController, didAuthorizePayment payment: PKPayment, handler completion: @escaping (PKPaymentAuthorizationResult) -> Void) {
        // Process payment using the payment token
        let paymentToken = payment.token // Example code, replace with your own implementation
        
        // Handle the payment and generate a result
        let result = PKPaymentAuthorizationResult(status: .success, errors: nil)
        
        // Complete the payment authorization process
        completion(result)
    }
}
```

5. Implement the `paymentAuthorizationViewControllerDidFinish(_:)` method delegate:

```swift
extension PaymentViewController {
    func paymentAuthorizationViewControllerDidFinish(_ controller: PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController) {
        // Dismiss the Payment Authorization View Controller
        dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
}
```

6. Call the `handlePaymentRequest()` function to initiate the Apple Pay payment process:

```swift
let paymentViewController = PaymentViewController()
await paymentViewController.handlePaymentRequest()
```

## Conclusion

With the new async/await syntax introduced in Swift 5.5, handling asynchronous tasks with Apple Pay has become more convenient and readable. By implementing the necessary delegates and utilizing the power of async/await, you can seamlessly integrate Apple Pay into your Swift applications. 

Remember to make sure your project is set up properly with the required capabilities and test your implementation on a device with Apple Pay support. Happy coding!
