One of the powerful features introduced in Swift 5.5 is the async/await syntax, which improves the readability and simplicity of asynchronous code. In this blog post, we will explore how to integrate async/await with Core NFC, Apple's framework for working with Near Field Communication (NFC) tags.

## Introduction

NFC is a technology that allows devices to communicate wirelessly by tapping them together or bringing them into close proximity. Core NFC provides developers with the ability to interact with NFC tags in their iOS apps.

Async/await is a new syntax introduced in Swift 5.5 that simplifies asynchronous programming. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks similar to synchronous code, making it easier to understand and maintain your codebase.

## Enable async/await in your project

To use async/await in your Swift project, you need to ensure that you are using Swift 5.5 or later. You can check your Swift version by running `swift --version` in your terminal.

If you are using Xcode, make sure you have Xcode 13 or later installed. Xcode 13 comes with Swift 5.5 by default.

## Using async/await with Core NFC

Let's assume you have already set up the necessary permissions and capabilities for NFC usage in your app. To use async/await with Core NFC, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the `CoreNFC` framework:

```swift
import CoreNFC
```

2. Create an instance of `NFCTagReaderSession`:

```swift
let nfcSession = NFCTagReaderSession(pollingOption: .iso15693, delegate: self)
```

3. Implement the `NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate`:

```swift
extension ViewController: NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate {
    func tagReaderSessionDidBecomeActive(_ session: NFCTagReaderSession) {
        // NFC session became active
    }

    func tagReaderSession(_ session: NFCTagReaderSession, didDetect tags: [NFCTag]) {
        tags.forEach { tag in
            // Handle the detected NFC tag
        }
    }

    func tagReaderSession(_ session: NFCTagReaderSession, didInvalidateWithError error: Error) {
        // NFC session invalidated
    }
}
```

4. Start the NFC session using async/await:

```swift
func startNFCSession() async throws {
    do {
        try await nfcSession.connect()
    } catch {
        // Handle the error
    }
}
```

5. Handle NFC tag detection using async/await:

```swift
func handleNFC(tag: NFCTag) async throws {
    switch tag {
    case let .iso15693(tag):
        try await tag.writeNDEF(...)
        // Other tag handling logic
    default:
        break
    }
}
```

6. Call the asynchronous functions from your main code:

```swift
async {
    do {
        try await startNFCSession()
    } catch {
        // Handle the error
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Async/await makes working with asynchronous code in Swift more intuitive and readable. By integrating async/await with Core NFC, you can simplify the asynchronous NFC tag reading and writing process in your iOS apps. Take advantage of Swift 5.5's new features to enhance your app's NFC capabilities.

Remember to test your NFC functionality thoroughly and handle errors appropriately to provide a seamless user experience. Happy coding!
