![Push Notifications](https://example.com/push_notifications.png)

Push notifications are a powerful tool for engaging and re-engaging users with your SwiftUI app. However, handling push notifications can sometimes involve asynchronous operations that can be tricky to manage. With the introduction of async/await in Swift 5.5, handling push notifications in SwiftUI has become more intuitive and easier to implement.

In this article, we'll explore how to incorporate async/await into a SwiftUI app to handle push notifications seamlessly.

## 1. Requesting user permission

Before we can handle push notifications, we need to request permission from the user to show them. This is typically done in the `AppDelegate` class. Here's an example of how you can request permission using `async/await`:

```swift
// Inside the AppDelegate class

func requestNotificationPermission() async {
    let center = UNUserNotificationCenter.current()
    let options: UNAuthorizationOptions = [.alert, .badge, .sound]
    
    do {
        try await center.requestAuthorization(options: options)
    } catch {
        print("Failed to request notification permission: \(error)")
    }
}
```

## 2. Handling push notifications in SwiftUI

Once we have obtained permission from the user, we can handle incoming push notifications in our SwiftUI app. Let's create a `PushNotificationHandler` class that conforms to the `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` protocol:

```swift
// Inside your SwiftUI app

class PushNotificationHandler: NSObject, UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate {
    
    func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter,
                                didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse,
                                withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void) {
        // Handle the push notification response
        completionHandler()
    }
    
    func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter,
                                willPresent notification: UNNotification,
                                withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationPresentationOptions) -> Void) {
        // Handle the push notification when the app is in foreground
        completionHandler([.banner, .sound, .badge])
    }
    
}
```

## 3. Registering the notification delegate

To enable our `PushNotificationHandler` to handle push notifications, we need to set it as the delegate for the notification center in our `AppDelegate`:

```swift
// Inside the AppDelegate class

func registerNotificationDelegate() {
    let center = UNUserNotificationCenter.current()
    let notificationDelegate = PushNotificationHandler()
    center.delegate = notificationDelegate
}
```

## 4. Example usage in SwiftUI views

Now that we have set up the push notification handling, we can utilize this feature in our SwiftUI views. For example, we can show a badge on a button when a notification is received:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var notificationBadge = false
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button(action: {
                // Perform action
            }) {
                Image(systemName: "bell")
                    .foregroundColor(.blue)
                    .overlay(
                        if notificationBadge {
                            Badge()
                        }
                    )
            }
        }
        .onReceive(NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: UIApplication.willEnterForegroundNotification)) { _ in
            async {
                let pendingNotifications = await UNUserNotificationCenter.current().getDeliveredNotifications()
                notificationBadge = !pendingNotifications.isEmpty
            }
        }
    }
}

struct Badge: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("1")
            .font(.caption)
            .foregroundColor(.white)
            .padding(4)
            .background(Color.red)
            .clipShape(Circle())
    }
}
```

In the above example, we use `onReceive` to observe the `UIApplication.willEnterForegroundNotification` and update the `notificationBadge` whenever the app comes back into the foreground. We utilize `async/await` to asynchronously retrieve pending notifications and determine if there are any that haven't been seen yet.

## Conclusion

Using `async/await` with push notifications in SwiftUI can greatly simplify the code and make it easier to manage asynchronous operations. By implementing the necessary delegates and utilizing the new concurrency features, handling push notifications seamlessly becomes straightforward.
