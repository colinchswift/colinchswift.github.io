Server-side Swift development has gained popularity in recent years, thanks to the introduction of SwiftNIO and frameworks like Vapor. With the release of Swift 5.5, Apple introduced `async/await` syntax, which simplifies asynchronous programming. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement `async/await` in a server-side Swift app.

## What is async/await?

`async/await` is a language-level feature that allows developers to write asynchronous code that looks and feels like synchronous code. With `async/await`, you can write code that includes asynchronous operations without the need for complex callback structures or explicit concurrency primitives.

## Preparing your environment

To start using `async/await` in a server-side Swift app, you need to ensure that you are using Swift 5.5 or later. You can verify this by running `swift --version` in your terminal. If necessary, update your Swift version using a package manager like `swiftenv` or `brew`.

## Converting asynchronous functions to use async/await

To convert existing asynchronous functions to use `async/await`, you need to follow these steps:

1. Define your function as `async` by adding the `async` keyword before the return type.
2. Replace callback-based asynchronous calls with their `await` equivalents.
3. Use the `try` keyword to handle errors.

Let's take an example of a server-side Swift function that fetches user data asynchronously:

```swift
func fetchUserData(completion: @escaping (Result<User, Error>) -> Void) {
    // Perform asynchronous network request
    // Call completion handler with result
}
```

To convert this function to use `async/await`, we can do the following:

```swift
func fetchUserData() async throws -> User {
    // Perform asynchronous network request
    // Return the user data directly
}
```

In the updated version, the function is marked as `async`, and instead of using a completion handler, we directly return the `User` object using the `throws` keyword to handle errors.

## Using async/await in your server-side Swift app

Once you have converted your functions to use `async/await`, you can use them in your server-side Swift app. Here's an example of how you can utilize `async/await` in a Vapor application:

```swift
import Vapor

func getUserHandler(req: Request) async throws -> User {
    let userId = try req.parameters.require("userId", as: UUID.self)
    let userData = await fetchUserData(with: userId)
    return userData
}

// Register the route with the router
app.get("users", ":userId", use: getUserHandler)
```

In the example above, we define a route handler function called `getUserHandler`. The function is marked as `async` and uses `await` to fetch the user data asynchronously. Finally, the user data is returned as the response.

## Conclusion

With the introduction of `async/await` in Swift 5.5, server-side Swift development becomes more expressive and easier to read. By converting your asynchronous functions to use `async/await`, you eliminate callback hell and make your code more readable and maintainable. Start leveraging `async/await` in your server-side Swift apps and experience the benefits of this powerful concurrency feature.
