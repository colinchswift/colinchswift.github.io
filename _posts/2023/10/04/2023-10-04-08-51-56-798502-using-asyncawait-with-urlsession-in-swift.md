In Swift, the traditional way of making asynchronous network requests is by using callbacks or completion handlers. However, with the introduction of async/await in Swift 5.5, we now have a more concise and readable way of handling asynchronous code. In this blog post, we will explore how to use async/await with URLSession to make network requests in Swift.

## What is async/await?

Async/await is a feature in Swift that simplifies asynchronous programming. It allows us to write asynchronous code in a sequential, synchronous manner, making it easier to understand and reason about. With async/await, you can mark a function as `async` and use the `await` keyword to pause the execution of a function until an asynchronous operation completes.

Async/await works hand in hand with structured concurrency, which ensures that all spawned tasks are properly handled and cleaned up. It also eliminates the need for callback nesting and makes error handling more straightforward.

## Using async/await with URLSession

To use async/await with URLSession, we need to take advantage of the new `Task` API introduced in Swift 5.5. The `Task` API provides a way to perform asynchronous operations and allows us to await the result.

Here's an example of making an HTTP GET request using async/await with URLSession:

```swift
import Foundation

async func fetchData(from url: URL) throws -> Data {
    let session = URLSession.shared
    let (data, _) = try await session.data(from: url)
    return data
}

do {
    let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/data")!
    let data = try await fetchData(from: url)
    // Process the data
} catch {
    // Handle the error
}
```

In the above example, we define an `async` function `fetchData` that accepts a URL and returns the fetched data. Internally, it uses `URLSession.data(from:)` method, which is marked with the `async` keyword, to fetch the data asynchronously. We use the `await` keyword to pause the execution of the function until the data is fetched.

Note that we need to mark the function with `async`, and when calling the function, we need to use `try await` to handle any potential errors that may occur during the asynchronous operation.

With async/await, we can write more readable and maintainable networking code, avoiding the complexity of callbacks and completion handlers.

## Conclusion

Using async/await with URLSession in Swift allows us to write asynchronous code in a more sequential and readable manner. It simplifies error handling and eliminates the need for nested callbacks. By taking advantage of the new `Task` API, we can easily make network requests and process the result without sacrificing code readability.

Overall, async/await is a powerful addition to Swift's concurrency model, making asynchronous programming more approachable and enabling developers to write more maintainable code.
