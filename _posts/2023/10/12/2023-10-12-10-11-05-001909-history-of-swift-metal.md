Swift Metal is an advanced graphics and compute API developed by Apple. It was introduced in June 2014 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). This blog post will take you through the history of Swift Metal and its significant milestones.

## Early Beginnings

At WWDC 2014, Apple announced the release of Swift, a new programming language designed for building iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps. Alongside Swift, Apple also introduced Metal, a high-performance graphics and compute API.

Metal was developed with the aim of providing a more efficient and low-level access to the GPU for rendering 3D graphics and performing parallel computations. It replaced the previously used OpenGL ES API for iOS and came with a range of improvements and features.

## Advancements in API Design

In subsequent years, Apple continued to enhance and refine Metal with new releases of iOS. With each release, Metal saw improvements in performance, flexibility, and ease of use. Apple focused on making Metal more accessible to developers and enabling them to take full advantage of the underlying graphical capabilities of Apple devices.

One major milestone was the introduction of Metal 2 at WWDC 2016. Metal 2 brought significant improvements, including support for machine learning, virtual reality, and external GPUs. It also introduced new features like GPU-driven pipeline state changes and improved resource management.

## Metal for macOS

In addition to its integration with iOS devices, Metal was also brought to macOS. With the release of macOS 10.11 El Capitan, developers gained the ability to use Metal for building high-performance graphics and compute applications on Mac computers. This further expanded the reach and adoption of Metal across Apple's product ecosystem.

## Metal Performance Shaders

Apple introduced Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) in 2015 as part of the iOS 9 update. MPS is a library that provides a set of highly optimized functions and kernels for performing common image and signal processing tasks on the GPU. It greatly simplifies and accelerates tasks such as convolution, filtering, and deep learning.

## Metal 2 and External GPU Support

At WWDC 2017, Apple announced Metal 2 as part of the macOS High Sierra update. Metal 2 further improved upon the capabilities of Metal, introducing features like accelerated machine learning, advanced rendering techniques, and support for external GPUs.

The introduction of external GPU support meant that Mac users could now connect external graphics cards to their machines, boosting their graphical performance and enabling them to run resource-intensive applications and games.

## Conclusion

Swift Metal has come a long way since its initial introduction in 2014. It has enabled developers to harness the power of Apple's GPUs more efficiently, leading to enhanced graphics and performance in iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps. With each iteration, Apple continues to innovate and improve Metal, making it an essential tool for developers in the Apple ecosystem.
