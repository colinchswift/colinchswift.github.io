The **Memento** design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows us to save and restore the state of an object without revealing its internal structure. It achieves this by creating a *Memento* object that stores the state of the object to be saved. This pattern is commonly used when we want to implement undo/redo functionality or ensure that an object can be rolled back to a previous state.

## How it works
The Memento pattern involves three main components:
1. **Originator**: This is the object whose state needs to be saved and restored. It creates and saves the Memento object.
2. **Memento**: This object stores the snapshot of the state of the Originator. It provides methods to retrieve the saved state and update the state of the Originator.
3. **Caretaker**: This object is responsible for storing and managing the Memento objects. It interacts with the Originator to save and restore its state.

## Example
Let's consider an example where we have a `TextEditor` class that allows users to write and edit text. We want to implement an undo/redo functionality that allows users to revert to a previous state of the text.

```java
class TextEditor {
    private String text;

    public void write(String text) {
        this.text += text;
    }

    public void undo() {
        // Restore the previous state from the Memento
    }

    public Memento save() {
        return new Memento(text);
    }

    public void restore(Memento memento) {
        this.text = memento.getState();
    }

    private class Memento {
        private String state;

        private Memento(String state) {
            this.state = state;
        }

        private String getState() {
            return state;
        }
    }
}

class Caretaker {
    private List<TextEditor.Memento> mementos = new ArrayList<>();

    public void saveState(TextEditor editor) {
        mementos.add(editor.save());
    }

    public void restoreState(TextEditor editor) {
        TextEditor.Memento lastMemento = mementos.remove(mementos.size() - 1);
        editor.restore(lastMemento);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `TextEditor` class represents the Originator. It has methods to write text, save the current state as a Memento, and restore the state from a given Memento. The Memento class is a private inner class of `TextEditor` and contains the state of the text. The `Caretaker` class is responsible for managing the Mementos and provides methods to save and restore the state of the `TextEditor`.

## Benefits
- Allows objects to be restored to a previous state easily.
- Encapsulates the internal state of an object, ensuring its privacy.
- Simplifies the implementation of undo/redo functionality.

## Conclusion
The Memento design pattern is a powerful tool when it comes to saving and restoring object states. By separating the state storage and management from the object itself, it provides a clean and flexible solution for implementing various functionalities like undo/redo in an application.

It's worth noting that the Memento pattern should be used judiciously, as storing large amounts of state information may impact performance and memory usage.
