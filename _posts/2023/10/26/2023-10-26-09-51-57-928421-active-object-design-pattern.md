In software engineering, the Active Object design pattern is used to separate method invocation from method execution in a multithreaded environment. This pattern ensures that method calls are encapsulated into objects, which are then placed into a queue to be executed by a separate thread, known as the scheduler. This allows for more efficient and predictable handling of multiple concurrent method invocations.

### Motivation

In a traditional multithreaded system, each method invocation directly executes on a separate thread. This can lead to several issues such as race conditions, deadlocks, and inefficient resource utilization. The Active Object design pattern addresses these problems by decoupling method invocation from execution.

### Structure

The Active Object pattern consists of the following key components:

1. **Proxy**: Acts as the interface for clients to invoke methods on the active object. It enqueues the method calls into a queue for execution.

2. **Scheduler**: Manages the execution of method calls from the queue. It ensures that the order of method invocations is maintained and can prioritize certain tasks if needed.

3. **Servant**: Represents the actual object that performs the method execution. It is responsible for processing the method calls in a synchronous manner.

4. **Method Call**: Encapsulates the method and its arguments. It is stored in the queue until it is picked up by the scheduler for execution.

### Example

Let's take a simple example to understand the Active Object pattern. Suppose we have an `Adder` class with a method `add` that adds two numbers. We want to make the `add` method asynchronous using the Active Object pattern.

```java
public interface Adder {
    int add(int a, int b);
}

public class AdderImpl implements Adder {
    @Override
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

public class ActiveObject {
    private final Queue<Runnable> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    private final Thread schedulerThread;

    public ActiveObject() {
        schedulerThread = new Thread(() -> {
            while (true) {
                if (!queue.isEmpty()) {
                    Runnable task = queue.poll();
                    task.run();
                }
            }
        });
        schedulerThread.start();
    }

    public void addTask(Runnable task) {
        queue.offer(task);
    }
}

// Usage
Adder adder = new AdderImpl();
ActiveObject activeObject = new ActiveObject();
activeObject.addTask(() -> {
    int result = adder.add(2, 3);
    System.out.println("Result: " + result);
});
```

In the above example, the `ActiveObject` acts as the proxy, while the `AdderImpl` class serves as the servant. The `addTask` method enqueues the method call (`add`) along with its arguments into the scheduler's queue. The scheduler thread picks up the task and executes it on the servant.

### Benefits

1. **Simplified concurrency**: The Active Object pattern simplifies concurrency by encapsulating method invocation and execution, reducing the chances of race conditions and deadlocks.

2. **Improved resource utilization**: By using a scheduler thread, the Active Object pattern allows for efficient management of system resources, ensuring that method invocations are executed in a controlled manner.

### Conclusion

The Active Object design pattern is a valuable tool for managing multithreaded environments. By decoupling method invocation and execution, it provides a more robust and efficient approach to handling concurrent method calls. This pattern has proven to be effective in various scenarios, where resource utilization and concurrency control are critical.
