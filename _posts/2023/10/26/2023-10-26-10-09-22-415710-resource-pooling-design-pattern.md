The Resource Pooling design pattern is a software architectural pattern that focuses on efficient resource management in an application. It is particularly useful when dealing with limited resources, such as database connections, network sockets, or threads.

In this pattern, a pool of available resources is created and managed centrally. Rather than creating a new resource every time it is needed, the application can reuse resources from the pool. This approach minimizes the overhead of creating and destroying resources, resulting in improved performance and efficiency.

**Benefits of Resource Pooling:**
- **Enhanced Performance**: By reusing resources from the pool, the application can avoid the overhead of resource creation and destruction, leading to improved performance.
- **Optimized Resource Utilization**: Since resources are shared and reused, the overall resource utilization can be optimized, allowing more efficient use of limited resources.
- **Scalability**: Resource pooling makes it easier to scale an application by efficiently managing and distributing available resources among multiple instances or threads.
- **Simplified Resource Management**: With a centralized resource pool, the application can easily manage and monitor the allocation and deallocation of resources.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create a pool of resources: Instantiate a pool object and populate it with available resources during the initialization phase.
2. Request a resource: When a resource is required, the application requests one from the pool.
3. Allocate a resource: The pool allocates an available resource from the pool to the requesting application.
4. Release a resource: Once the resource's task is completed, the application releases the resource back to the pool, making it available for the next requester.

**Example Code:**

```java
public class ResourcePool<T> {
    private Queue<T> pool;

    public ResourcePool() {
        pool = new LinkedList<>();
    }

    public void addResource(T resource) {
        pool.add(resource);
    }

    public synchronized T getResource() {
        while (pool.isEmpty()) {
            try {
                wait();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                // handle interrupt exception
            }
        }
        return pool.poll();
    }

    public synchronized void releaseResource(T resource) {
        pool.add(resource);
        notifyAll();
    }
}
```

In this example, we implement a generic resource pool using a queue data structure. The `getResource()` method returns an available resource from the pool, waiting if no resources are currently available. The `releaseResource()` method adds the released resource back to the pool and notifies waiting threads.

**Conclusion:**

The Resource Pooling design pattern is a valuable technique for managing limited resources efficiently in an application. It offers several benefits, including enhanced performance, optimized resource utilization, scalability, and simplified resource management. By reusing resources from a centralized pool, applications can avoid excessive resource creation and destruction overhead. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where the cost of resource creation is high or the number of available resources is limited.
