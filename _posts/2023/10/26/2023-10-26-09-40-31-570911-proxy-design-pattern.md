The proxy design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows for the creation of a surrogate object, known as a proxy, which acts as a placeholder for another object. The proxy controls access to the real object and can add additional functionality before or after the actual method execution.

## When to use the Proxy Design Pattern?
The proxy design pattern is often used in situations where we want to add a level of indirection to the original object, providing a more controlled or efficient access to it. Some common scenarios where the proxy design pattern can be applied include:

- **Remote Proxies**: When the real object resides in a different address space, possibly on a remote server. The proxy acts as a local representative for the remote object, handling the communication and marshalling the requests and responses.

- **Virtual Proxies**: When the object being proxied is resource-intensive to create or load. The proxy delays the creation or loading of the real object until it is actually needed, improving performance by minimizing unnecessary operations.

- **Protection Proxies**: When the proxy is responsible for controlling access to the real object and enforcing additional security or authorization rules. The proxy can validate the user's permissions before allowing access to certain methods or data.

## Example

Let's consider the scenario of a photo gallery application where we want to display high-resolution images. However, loading and displaying these images can be resource-intensive and may impact the performance of the application.

To address this, we can use the proxy design pattern. We define an `Image` interface that represents the operations we can perform on an image. We also have a `RealImage` class that implements the `Image` interface and loads the actual image from disk when requested.

```java
public interface Image {
    void display();
}

public class RealImage implements Image {
    private String filename;

    public RealImage(String filename) {
        this.filename = filename;
        loadFromDisk();
    }

    private void loadFromDisk() {
        // Load image from disk
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        // Display the image
    }
}
```

Now, we can introduce a `ProxyImage` class that acts as a proxy for the `RealImage`. It only loads and displays the actual image when necessary, improving performance by avoiding unnecessary loading.

```java
public class ProxyImage implements Image {
    private String filename;
    private RealImage realImage;

    public ProxyImage(String filename) {
        this.filename = filename;
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        if (realImage == null) {
            realImage = new RealImage(filename);
        }
        realImage.display();
    }
}
```

In the client code, we can use the `ProxyImage` to display the images without worrying about the loading process.

```java
Image image1 = new ProxyImage("image1.jpg");
Image image2 = new ProxyImage("image2.jpg");

// The real images are only loaded when needed
image1.display();
image2.display();
```

## Conclusion
The proxy design pattern offers a way to control and add additional functionality to objects. It allows for the creation of objects that act as proxies for real objects, providing a more controlled and efficient way of accessing them. By using the proxy design pattern, we can improve performance, provide security, and add additional functionality to our applications.
