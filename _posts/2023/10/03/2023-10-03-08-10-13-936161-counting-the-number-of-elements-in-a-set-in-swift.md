```swift
// Create a set of integers
let numbers: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

// Count the number of elements in the set
let count = numbers.count
print("Count: \(count)")  // Output: Count: 5
```

In the above example, we first define a set of integers called `numbers`. We then use the `count` property to retrieve the number of elements in the set, which is stored in the `count` constant. Finally, we print the count to the console.

By using the `count` property, you can easily determine how many elements are present in a set in Swift. This can be useful for various scenarios, such as checking if a set is empty or validating the size of a set before performing certain operations.
