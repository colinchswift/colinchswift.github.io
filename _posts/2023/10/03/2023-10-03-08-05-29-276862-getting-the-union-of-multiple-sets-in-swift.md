In Swift, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. To find the union of multiple sets, which is a new set containing all the elements present in any of the input sets, you can use the `union(_:)` method provided by the `Set` class.

Here's an example code snippet in Swift:

```swift
var set1: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3]
var set2: Set<Int> = [3, 4, 5]
var set3: Set<Int> = [5, 6, 7]

let unionSet = set1.union(set2).union(set3)
print(unionSet)
```

In this code, we have three sets: `set1`, `set2`, and `set3`. Using the `union(_:)` method, we can find the union of these sets. The `union(_:)` method returns a new set that contains all the elements from the original set as well as the elements from the passed set. By chaining the `union(_:)` method, we can find the union of all three sets.

The output of the above code will be:

```
[4, 2, 1, 6, 3, 7, 5]
```

In this case, the `unionSet` contains all the unique elements from `set1`, `set2`, and `set3`.

By using the `union(_:)` method, you can easily find the union of multiple sets in Swift. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to combine elements from different sets without duplicates.
