In Swift, sets are a powerful data structure that allow you to store unique values. Sometimes, you may need to combine multiple sets into a single set. In this blog post, we will explore how to achieve this using a ternary operation.

## The Ternary Operation

The ternary operation in Swift is a concise way to write conditional statements. It has the following syntax:

```
condition ? trueExpression : falseExpression
```

## Combining Sets

To combine multiple sets, we can use the ternary operation along with the `union` method provided by the `Set` class in Swift.

Let's say we have three sets:

```swift
let setA: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3]
let setB: Set<Int> = [2, 3, 4]
let setC: Set<Int> = [3, 4, 5]
```

We want to combine these sets into a single set, `combinedSet`, without any duplicate values.

```swift
let combinedSet = setA.union(setB).union(setC)
```

In the above code, we use the `union` method to combine `setA` and `setB`, and then again to combine the result with `setC`. This effectively combines all three sets into `combinedSet`.

Alternatively, we can achieve the same result using a ternary operation:

```swift
let combinedSet = setA.union(setB.union(setC))
```

In this case, the ternary operation is used within the `union` method call to combine `setB` and `setC`, which is then combined with `setA`.

## Conclusion

Using a ternary operation in Swift, along with the `union` method, allows us to easily combine multiple sets into a single set. It provides a clean and concise way to achieve this operation. 

By leveraging these techniques, you can efficiently work with sets in Swift and manipulate them as needed.

Remember to use this ternary operation wisely and suitably in your code to achieve cleaner and more readable results.
