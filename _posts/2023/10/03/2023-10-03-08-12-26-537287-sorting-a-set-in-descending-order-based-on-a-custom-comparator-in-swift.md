When working with sets in Swift, there may be times when you need to sort them in a specific order, such as descending order. However, sets in Swift are unordered collections, and they don't have a built-in sorting mechanism like arrays do.

To sort a set in descending order based on a custom comparator, we can follow these steps:

1. Convert the set to an array.
2. Use the `sort(by:)` method on the array to apply the custom comparator and sort the elements.
3. Convert the sorted array back to a set.

Here's an example of how you can accomplish this in Swift:

```swift
import Foundation

// Define a custom comparator function
let comparator: (Int, Int) -> Bool = { $0 > $1 }

// Create a set of numbers
var numbers: Set<Int> = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]

// Convert the set to an array and sort it using the custom comparator
let sortedArray = numbers.sorted(by: comparator)

// Convert the sorted array back to a set
let sortedSet: Set<Int> = Set(sortedArray)
```

In this example, we defined a custom comparator function `comparator` which compares two integers in a descending order. We created a set called `numbers` with some random numbers. Then, we converted the set to an array using the `sorted(by:)` method, passing in our custom comparator. Finally, we converted the sorted array back to a set using the `Set` initializer.

By following these steps, we were able to sort the set `numbers` in descending order based on our custom comparator.

Remember to adapt the custom comparator function and data types to your specific case.
