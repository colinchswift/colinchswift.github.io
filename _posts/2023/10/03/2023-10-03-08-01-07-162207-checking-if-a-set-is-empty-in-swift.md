# Method 1: Using the .isEmpty property

One straightforward and clean way to check if a set is empty is to use the `.isEmpty` property. This property returns a boolean value indicating whether the set is empty or not.

```swift
let fruits: Set<String> = []

if fruits.isEmpty {
    print("The set is empty.")
} else {
    print("The set is not empty.")
}
```

# Method 2: Using count

Another way to check if a set is empty is by using the `count` property. If the count is equal to 0, it means the set is empty.

```swift
let fruits: Set<String> = []

if fruits.count == 0 {
    print("The set is empty.")
} else {
    print("The set is not empty.")
}
```

# Method 3: Check if the set first element exists

In Swift, sets are unordered collections. We can check if a set is empty by checking if the first element exists or not. If there are no elements, then the set is empty.

```swift
let fruits: Set<String> = []

if fruits.first == nil {
    print("The set is empty.")
} else {
    print("The set is not empty.")
}
```

Using any of these methods will allow you to check if a set is empty in Swift. Choose the method that best suits your coding style and requirements, and ensure your code runs smoothly and efficiently.
