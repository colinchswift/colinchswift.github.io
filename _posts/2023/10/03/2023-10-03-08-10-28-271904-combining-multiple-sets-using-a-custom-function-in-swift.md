When working with sets in Swift, there may be scenarios where you need to combine multiple sets into a single set. While Swift provides built-in set operations like `union`, `intersection`, and `subtract`, there may be cases where you need to use a custom function to combine sets based on a specific condition.

In this blog post, we will explore how to combine multiple sets using a custom function in Swift. We will assume that you have a basic understanding of sets and their operations in Swift.

## The Problem

Let's say we have three sets representing different categories of books: `fictionSet`, `nonFictionSet`, and `classicSet`. Each set contains books of a specific category. Our goal is to combine these sets into a single set called `allBooksSet`, but with a custom condition.

We want to add books to `allBooksSet` only if they are not present in the `fictionSet` and `nonFictionSet`. If a book is present in the `classicSet`, it will be added regardless of its presence in the other sets.

## The Solution

To achieve this, we can define a custom function that takes these sets as input and returns a combined set based on our condition. Here's an example of how we can do that:

```swift
func combineSets(fictionSet: Set<String>, nonFictionSet: Set<String>, classicSet: Set<String>) -> Set<String> {
    var allBooksSet = classicSet

    for book in fictionSet {
        if !allBooksSet.contains(book) {
            allBooksSet.insert(book)
        }
    }

    for book in nonFictionSet {
        if !allBooksSet.contains(book) {
            allBooksSet.insert(book)
        }
    }

    return allBooksSet
}

// Example usage
let fictionSet: Set<String> = ["Harry Potter", "Lord of the Rings"]
let nonFictionSet: Set<String> = ["Sapiens", "Influence"]
let classicSet: Set<String> = ["Pride and Prejudice", "To Kill a Mockingbird"]

let allBooksSet = combineSets(fictionSet: fictionSet, nonFictionSet: nonFictionSet, classicSet: classicSet)
print(allBooksSet) // Output: ["Pride and Prejudice", "To Kill a Mockingbird", "Harry Potter", "Lord of the Rings", "Sapiens", "Influence"]
```

In the above code, we define the `combineSets` function that takes the three sets as parameters. We initialize `allBooksSet` as equal to `classicSet` since we want to include all books from the `classicSet` regardless of their presence in other sets.

We then iterate over the `fictionSet` and `nonFictionSet` and check if each book is already present in `allBooksSet` using the `contains` method. If not, we add it to the `allBooksSet` using the `insert` method.

Finally, we return the combined `allBooksSet`.

## Conclusion

By using a custom function, we can combine multiple sets in Swift based on a specific condition. In this example, we combined sets of books, ensuring that books from the `classicSet` are always included and avoiding duplications in the final combined set.

Using custom functions allows for flexibility and the ability to incorporate complex conditions when combining sets. So, the next time you need to combine sets with a specific requirement, consider creating a custom function tailored to your needs.
