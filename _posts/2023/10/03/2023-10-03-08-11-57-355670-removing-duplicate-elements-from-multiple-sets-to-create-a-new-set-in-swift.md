## Introduction

In Swift, sets are a powerful data structure that allows you to store unordered and unique elements. However, there may be times when you have multiple sets and you need to combine them into a new set while removing any duplicate elements. In this blog post, we will explore the various ways to remove duplicate elements from multiple sets and create a new set in the Swift programming language.

## Method 1: Using the Union Function

One way to remove duplicate elements from multiple sets is by using the `union` function provided by the `Set` data structure in Swift.

```swift
var set1: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4]
var set2: Set<Int> = [3, 4, 5, 6]
var set3: Set<Int> = [5, 6, 7, 8]

var combinedSet = set1.union(set2).union(set3)
print(combinedSet) // Output: [5, 6, 1, 7, 2, 3, 4, 8]
```

In the above code snippet, we have three sets `set1`, `set2`, and `set3`. We use the `union` function to combine them into the `combinedSet` while removing any duplicate elements. The resulting set is printed, showing the elements in an unordered manner.

## Method 2: Using Set Operations

Another approach to remove duplicate elements from multiple sets is by using set operations such as `intersection`, `subtracting`, and `symmetricDifference`.

```swift
var set1: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4]
var set2: Set<Int> = [3, 4, 5, 6]
var set3: Set<Int> = [5, 6, 7, 8]

var combinedSet = set1.union(set2).union(set3)
var uniqueSet = combinedSet.subtracting(set1.intersection(set2).intersection(set3))
print(uniqueSet) // Output: [1, 2, 7, 8]
```

In the above code snippet, we first combine the three sets using the `union` function similar to Method 1. However, to remove the duplicate elements, we use set operations to subtract the intersection of all sets from the combined set. This results in the `uniqueSet` containing only the elements that are not present in all three sets.

## Conclusion

Removing duplicate elements from multiple sets to create a new set in Swift is made easy using the `Set` data structure and its built-in functions. Both methods discussed in this blog post provide an efficient way to combine sets and remove duplicates, allowing you to work with unique elements without much effort.
