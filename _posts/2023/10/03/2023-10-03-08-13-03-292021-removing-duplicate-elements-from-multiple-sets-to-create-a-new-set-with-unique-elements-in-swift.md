Duplicate elements in a set can cause inconsistencies and lead to incorrect results in your program. To ensure the uniqueness of elements, Swift provides a simple way to remove duplicates across multiple sets and create a new set with unique elements. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to achieve this in Swift.

## Approach

To remove duplicate elements from multiple sets and create a new set with unique elements, we can combine the sets using the union method and convert the result to a set. Since sets only contain unique elements, any duplicates will automatically be removed. Here's the approach in code:

```swift
let set1: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3]
let set2: Set<Int> = [2, 3, 4]
let set3: Set<Int> = [3, 4, 5]

let uniqueElements = Set(set1).union(set2).union(set3)
```

Here, we have three sets, `set1`, `set2`, and `set3`. We use the `union` method to combine the sets, starting with `set1` and adding `set2` and `set3`. Finally, we convert the result to a set using the `Set` initializer.

The `uniqueElements` set will contain `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, with all duplicate elements removed.

## Example

Let's see a complete example that demonstrates removing duplicates from multiple sets:

```swift
let set1: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3]
let set2: Set<Int> = [2, 3, 4]
let set3: Set<Int> = [3, 4, 5]

let uniqueElements = Set(set1).union(set2).union(set3)

print(uniqueElements) // Output: [5, 2, 3, 1, 4]
```

In this example, we have three sets: `set1`, `set2`, and `set3`, each containing a different set of integers. We use the approach described earlier to combine the sets and create the `uniqueElements` set. Finally, we print the result to verify that the duplicates have been removed.

## Conclusion

Removing duplicate elements from multiple sets to create a new set with unique elements is a common task in Swift. By using the `union` method and converting the result to a set, we can easily achieve this. This approach ensures the uniqueness of elements and provides a clean and efficient solution.
