Here's an example of how you can insert an element at a specific position in a set using an array in Swift:

```swift
var set: Set<String> = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]
var orderedSet: [String] = []

// Copy elements from set to an orderedSet array
orderedSet.append(contentsOf: set)

// Insert a new element at a specific position
let element = "Mango"
let position = 1
orderedSet.insert(element, at: position)

// Convert the orderedSet back to a set
set = Set(orderedSet)

print(set) // Output: ["Apple", "Mango", "Banana", "Orange"]
```

In the above example, we first declare a set called `set` with some initial elements. Then, we create an empty array called `orderedSet` to maintain the order of elements.

Next, we copy all the elements from the set to the orderedSet array using the `append(contentsOf:)` method. This ensures the order of elements is preserved.

After that, we can use the `insert(_:at:)` method to insert a new element (`"Mango"`) at a specific position (`1`) in the orderedSet array.

Finally, we convert the orderedSet array back to a set to get the updated set with the inserted element.

Note: Modifying an element's position in a set goes against the nature of a set, which is unordered. The example above achieves the desired behavior by using an array to maintain ordering.
