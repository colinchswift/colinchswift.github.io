Sets in Swift are useful when you need to work with a collection of unique values. In some scenarios, you may have multiple sets and you want to get the difference between them. In this blog post, we will explore how to achieve this using Swift.

To get the difference of multiple sets in Swift, we can use the `subtract` method provided by the `Set` class. Let's see an example:

```swift
let setA: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let setB: Set<Int> = [4, 5, 6, 7]
let setC: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 6, 8]

// Get the difference of setA, setB, and setC
let difference = setA.subtracting(setB).subtracting(setC)

print(difference) // Output: [3]

```

In the above example, we have three sets: `setA`, `setB`, and `setC`. We want to find the values that are present in `setA` but not in `setB` and `setC`.

To get the difference, we first subtract `setB` from `setA` using the `subtract` method, which removes the elements of `setB` from `setA`. Then, we subtract `setC` from the updated `setA` to get the final difference.

The result is stored in the `difference` constant, which will contain the elements that are unique to `setA`.

Finally, we print the difference and the output will be `[3]`.

By using this approach, you can easily find the difference between multiple sets in Swift.
