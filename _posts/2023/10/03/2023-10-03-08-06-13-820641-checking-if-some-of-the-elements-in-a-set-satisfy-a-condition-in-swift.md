Here's an example to illustrate how you can use `contains(where:)` to check if any element in a set satisfies a condition:

```swift
let numbers: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

let isEvenNumberPresent = numbers.contains { $0 % 2 == 0 }
print("Is there any even number in the set? \(isEvenNumberPresent)")
```

In the above code, we have a set of integers named `numbers` that contains the values from 1 to 5. We use the `contains(where:)` method on the `numbers` set and pass a closure as its argument. The closure checks if a number is divisible by 2, indicating it is even.

The closure takes an element as its parameter (represented by `$0`) and returns a `Bool` value indicating whether the condition is satisfied. If any element in the set satisfies the condition, the `contains(where:)` method returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

In this case, since the set `numbers` contains the even number 2, the `isEvenNumberPresent` variable will be `true`. You can customize the closure to match your specific condition, depending on the elements in your set.

By using `contains(where:)`, you can easily check if any elements in a set satisfy a condition, providing a convenient and efficient way to handle such scenarios in Swift.
