Sets in the Swift programming language are a collection type that is commonly used to store unique elements. Occasionally, you may need to find the distinct elements within a set. In this blog post, we will explore different approaches to accomplish this task using Swift.

## Approach 1: Converting Set to Array

The simplest approach to finding the distinct elements in a set is by converting the set into an array and then using the built-in `Set` initializer to create a new set with only the unique elements. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates this approach:

```swift
let set: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 3]
let distinctElements = Array(set)
let distinctSet = Set(distinctElements)

print(distinctSet) // Output: [3, 2, 1, 4, 5]
```

In the code above, we start with a set `set` that contains duplicate elements. We then convert the set into an array using the `Array` initializer. Finally, we create a new set `distinctSet` by initializing it with the array of distinct elements. The output confirms that the duplicate elements have been removed.

## Approach 2: Using a Helper Function

Alternatively, we can define a helper function that iterates over the elements of the set and adds them to a new set only if they have not been encountered before. Here's an example implementation:

```swift
func distinctElements<T>(in set: Set<T>) -> Set<T> {
    var distinctSet = Set<T>()
    for element in set {
        distinctSet.insert(element)
    }
    return distinctSet
}

let set: Set<String> = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "apple", "banana"]
let distinctSet = distinctElements(in: set)

print(distinctSet) // Output: ["banana", "orange", "apple"]
```

In the code above, we define a generic function `distinctElements` that takes a set as input and returns a new set containing only the distinct elements. Inside the function, we iterate over each element in the input set and insert it into the `distinctSet`. Since sets automatically remove duplicate elements, the `distinctSet` contains only unique elements.

## Conclusion

Finding the distinct elements in a set in Swift can be achieved using various approaches. Whether you prefer converting the set to an array or using a helper function, the end result is the same: a set containing only unique elements. Choose the approach that best suits your needs and remember to leverage Swift's powerful collection APIs to simplify your code.
