When working with sets in Swift, you may often encounter a situation where you need to find the unique elements present in the combined set of two sets. In this article, we will explore how to achieve this using Swift's built-in set operations.

## Approach

To find the unique elements in the combined set of two sets, we can utilize the `union` and `subtracting` methods provided by Swift's `Set` type.

First, we need to combine the two sets into one set using the `union` method. This will create a new set that contains all the elements from both sets without duplicates. Then, we can subtract one set from the other using the `subtracting` method to remove the common elements and get the unique elements.

## Example Code

```swift
let set1: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4]
let set2: Set<Int> = [3, 4, 5, 6]

let combinedSet = set1.union(set2)
let uniqueElements = combinedSet.subtracting(set1)

print(uniqueElements) // Output: [5, 6]
```

In the above example, we have two sets `set1` and `set2` containing integer elements. We first combine them using the `union` method, resulting in the combinedSet containing the elements [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Then, we use the `subtracting` method to subtract `set1` from `combinedSet`, resulting in the uniqueElements set that contains the elements [5, 6] which are not present in `set1` but in `set2`.

## Conclusion

By using the `union` and `subtracting` methods provided by Swift's `Set` type, we can easily find the unique elements in the combined set of two sets. This method is efficient and provides a clean and concise way to handle set operations in Swift.
