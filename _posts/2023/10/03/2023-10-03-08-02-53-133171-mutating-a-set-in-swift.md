Sets in Swift are used to store unique values of the same type in an unordered collection. Unlike arrays, sets do not maintain the order of the elements. However, sets provide various methods to add, remove, and mutate their contents.

In this blog post, we will explore different ways to mutate a set in Swift, including adding and removing elements.

## Adding Elements to a Set

To add elements to a set in Swift, we can use the `insert(_:)` method or the `formUnion(_:)` method.

The `insert(_:)` method allows us to add a single element to the set. Here's an example:

```swift
var fruits: Set<String> = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]
fruits.insert("grape")
print(fruits) // Output: ["orange", "grape", "banana", "apple"]
```

The `formUnion(_:)` method is used to add the elements of another set to the set. It modifies the set in place. Here's an example:

```swift
var set1: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3]
let set2: Set<Int> = [4, 5, 6]
set1.formUnion(set2)
print(set1) // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
Note that the elements added using `formUnion(_:)` do not guarantee any specific order.

## Removing Elements from a Set

To remove elements from a set in Swift, we can use the `remove(_:)` method or the `subtract(_:)` method.

The `remove(_:)` method allows us to remove a specific element from the set. Here's an example:

```swift
var cities: Set<String> = ["New York", "London", "Tokyo"]
cities.remove("London")
print(cities) // Output: ["Tokyo", "New York"]
```

The `subtract(_:)` method is used to remove the elements of another set from the set. It modifies the set in place. Here's an example:

```swift
var set1: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let set2: Set<Int> = [2, 4, 6]
set1.subtract(set2)
print(set1) // Output: [1, 3, 5]
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored different ways to mutate a set in Swift. We learned how to add elements using the `insert(_:)` and `formUnion(_:)` methods, and how to remove elements using the `remove(_:)` and `subtract(_:)` methods. By understanding these methods, you can efficiently manipulate the contents of a set in your Swift programs.
