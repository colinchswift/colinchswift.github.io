Suppose you have two sets in Swift and you want to check if one set is a proper superset of another set. A proper superset means that the first set contains all the elements of the second set and has at least one additional element.

To perform this check in Swift, you can utilize the `isStrictSuperset(of:)` method provided by the `Set` class.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to check if a set is a proper superset of another set:

```swift
let set1: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let set2: Set<Int> = [3, 4]

if set1.isStrictSuperset(of: set2) {
    print("set1 is a proper superset of set2")
} else {
    print("set1 is not a proper superset of set2")
}
```

In the above example, `set1` is a set that contains the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. On the other hand, `set2` is a set that contains only the elements 3 and 4.

By calling the `isStrictSuperset(of:)` method on `set1` and passing `set2` as the argument, we are able to check if `set1` is a proper superset of `set2`. If the method returns `true`, it means that `set1` contains all the elements of `set2` as well as some additional elements.

Keep in mind that the `isStrictSuperset(of:)` method is available for any type that conforms to the `SetAlgebra` protocol in Swift, not just for sets of integers.

By utilizing this method, you can easily check if one set is a proper superset of another set in Swift, helping you to make informed decisions in your code logic.
