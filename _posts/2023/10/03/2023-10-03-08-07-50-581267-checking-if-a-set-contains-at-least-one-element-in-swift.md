In Swift, you can use the `isEmpty` property of a Set to check if it is empty or not. However, if you want to specifically check if a Set contains at least one element, you can use the `count` property.

```swift
let mySet: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3]

if mySet.count != 0 {
    print("Set contains at least one element")
} else {
    print("Set is empty")
}
```

Alternatively, you can utilize the `first` property of a Set to check if it is `nil` or not. If the `first` property is `nil`, it means the Set is empty.

```swift
let mySet: Set<String> = []

if mySet.first != nil {
    print("Set contains at least one element")
} else {
    print("Set is empty")
}
```

It is important to note that the recommendation to check if a set is empty is to use the `isEmpty` property instead of comparing the `count` to zero, as it is more readable and idiomatic in Swift. The `isEmpty` property returns a `Bool` indicating whether the Set is empty or not.

```swift
let mySet: Set<Character> = []

if mySet.isEmpty {
    print("Set is empty")
} else {
    print("Set contains at least one element")
}
```

By using these techniques, you can easily check if a Set contains at least one element in Swift. #Swift #SetOperations
