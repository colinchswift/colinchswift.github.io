In Swift, a set is an unordered collection of unique values. If you have a set and you want to update an element at a specific position, you'll need to convert the set to an array, update the element at the desired position, and then create a new set from the updated array.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to update an element at a specific position in a set in Swift:

```swift
var mySet: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
var myArray = Array(mySet)

// Update element at position 2
let indexToUpdate = 2
if indexToUpdate < myArray.count {
    let updatedElement = 10
    myArray[indexToUpdate] = updatedElement
} else {
    print("Index out of range")
}

mySet = Set(myArray)
print(mySet) // Output: [1, 2, 10, 4, 5]
```

In this example, we have a set called `mySet` with the elements `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. We first convert the set to an array using the `Array()` initializer. Then, we update the element at index 2 to the value 10. Finally, we convert the updated array back to a set using the `Set()` initializer.

Note that the index you want to update should be within the range of the array's indices. Otherwise, you'll need to handle the index out of range scenario accordingly.

Using this approach, you can successfully update an element at a specific position in a set in Swift.
