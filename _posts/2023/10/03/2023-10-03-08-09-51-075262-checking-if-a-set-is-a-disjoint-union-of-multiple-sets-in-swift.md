When working with sets in Swift, you may often come across situations where you need to check if a set is a disjoint union of multiple sets. In other words, you want to verify if a set contains elements that are exclusively found in each of the individual sets.

Here's an example code snippet demonstrating how you can determine if a set is a disjoint union of multiple sets in Swift:

```swift
let set1: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3]
let set2: Set<Int> = [4, 5, 6]
let set3: Set<Int> = [7, 8, 9]

let combinedSet = set1.union(set2).union(set3)

// Check if the combined set contains elements exclusively found in set1, set2, and set3
let isDisjointUnion = combinedSet.isSuperset(of: set1) &&
                      combinedSet.isSuperset(of: set2) &&
                      combinedSet.isSuperset(of: set3)

if isDisjointUnion {
    print("The sets are a disjoint union.")
} else {
    print("The sets are not a disjoint union.")
}
```

In the above example, we have three sets `set1`, `set2`, and `set3`. By using the `union` method, we combine all three sets into a `combinedSet`.

Next, we use the `isSuperset(of:)` method to check if the `combinedSet` contains all the elements from each individual set. If all three sets are subsets of the combined set, we can conclude that the sets are a disjoint union.

Finally, based on the result of the check, we print out an appropriate message indicating whether the sets are a disjoint union or not.

By using this approach, you can easily determine if a set is a disjoint union of multiple sets in Swift. Feel free to modify the example code to suit your specific use case.
