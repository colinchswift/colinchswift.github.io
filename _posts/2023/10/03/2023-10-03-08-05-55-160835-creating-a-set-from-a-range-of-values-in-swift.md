To create a set from a range of values, follow these steps:

1. Define the range of values you want to create a set from. For example, let's say we have a range of integers from 1 to 5:

   ```swift
   let range = 1...5
   ```
   
2. Use the `Set` initializer to create a set from the range:

   ```swift
   let set = Set(range)
   ```
   
   The `Set` initializer takes a sequence as its parameter and constructs a set with the unique elements in that sequence. In this case, the range is a sequence of integers, so a set containing the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 will be created.
   
3. You can now use the `set` variable to perform set operations or access its elements:

   ```swift
   print(set) // Output: [3, 2, 5, 4, 1]
   ```
   
   The elements of a set are unordered, so the order of the elements in the output may vary.

Creating a set from a range of values allows you to easily eliminate duplicates and work with the unique elements. Sets in Swift have useful operations like set arithmetic, subset checking, and more, which can be beneficial in various scenarios.
