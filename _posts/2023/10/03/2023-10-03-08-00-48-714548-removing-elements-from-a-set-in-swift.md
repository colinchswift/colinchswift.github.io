```swift
var fruits: Set<String> = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grapes"]

fruits.remove("banana")
print(fruits) // Output: ["apple", "orange", "grapes"]
```

In the example above, we have a set called `fruits` that contains four elements. We then use the `remove(_ member: Element)` method to remove the element "banana" from the set. After removing the element, we print the contents of the set and it will output `["apple", "orange", "grapes"]`.

Additionally, you can also remove all elements from a set using the `removeAll()` method. This method removes all elements, making the set empty. Here's an example:

```swift
var fruits: Set<String> = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grapes"]

fruits.removeAll()
print(fruits) // Output: []
```

In this example, we use the `removeAll()` method to remove all elements from the `fruits` set. After removing all elements, when we print the set, it will output an empty set `[]`.

By using these methods, you can easily remove elements from a set in Swift. Remember to use the appropriate method based on your requirement: `remove(_ member: Element)` to remove a specific element, or `removeAll()` to remove all elements. #Swift #Set
