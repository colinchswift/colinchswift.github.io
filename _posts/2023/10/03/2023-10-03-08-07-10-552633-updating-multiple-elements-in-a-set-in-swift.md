Sets in Swift are a powerful data structure that allow you to store unique elements. Sometimes, you may need to update multiple elements in a set simultaneously. In this blog post, we will explore different techniques to achieve this efficiently in Swift.

## Method 1: Using a for loop

One way to update multiple elements in a set is by iterating over the set and performing the updates using a for loop. Here's an example:

```swift
var set: Set<String> = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Grape"]

for element in set {
    if element.hasPrefix("A") {
        set.update(with: "Updated \(element)")
    }
}

print(set) // Output: ["Updated Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Grape"]
```

In this example, we iterate over each element in the set and check if it starts with the letter "A". If it does, we update the element by adding the prefix "Updated ".

## Method 2: Using `forEach` method

An alternative approach is to use the `forEach` method available on sets. Here's how you can use it:

```swift
var set: Set<String> = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Grape"]

set.forEach { element in
    if element.hasPrefix("A") {
        set.update(with: "Updated \(element)")
    }
}

print(set) // Output: ["Updated Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Grape"]
```

In this method, we use the `forEach` method to iterate over each element in the set and perform the necessary updates.

## Conclusion

Updating multiple elements in a set can be achieved using either a for loop or the `forEach` method. Both methods allow you to efficiently iterate over the set and update the elements based on your requirements.

By leveraging the power of Swift sets and using these techniques, you can easily update multiple elements in a set and manage your data effectively.
