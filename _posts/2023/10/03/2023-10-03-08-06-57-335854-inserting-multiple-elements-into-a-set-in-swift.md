Here's how you can insert multiple elements into a Set in Swift:

```swift
var mySet: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3] // Initial set with three elements

let newElements: Set<Int> = [4, 5, 6] // New elements to be added

// Using union function
let updatedSet = mySet.union(newElements)
print(updatedSet) // Output: [5, 2, 4, 1, 6, 3]

// Using += operator
mySet += newElements
print(mySet) // Output: [5, 2, 4, 1, 6, 3]
```

In the code snippet above, we have an initial set `mySet` with elements [1, 2, 3]. We declare a new set `newElements` with the additional elements [4, 5, 6] that we want to add to `mySet`.

To add the elements, we can use the `union` function, which creates a new set containing all elements from both sets, or we can use the `+=` operator, which modifies the existing set in-place.

After adding the elements, we print the updated set and expect to see [5, 2, 4, 1, 6, 3]. Note that Sets are unordered, so the ordering of elements may vary.

By using the `union` function or the `+=` operator, you can efficiently insert multiple elements into a Set in Swift. Keep in mind that Sets only contain unique values, so any duplicates will be ignored.
