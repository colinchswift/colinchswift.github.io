In Swift, you can easily check whether a set is a subset or superset of another set using built-in set operations. This can be useful when you need to compare sets and determine their relationship to each other.

## Checking Subset Relationship

To check if a set is a subset of another set, you can use the `isSubset(of:)` method. This method returns a Boolean value indicating whether every element of the calling set is also present in the target set.

Here's an example:

```swift
let setA: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3]
let setB: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

if setA.isSubset(of: setB) {
    print("setA is a subset of setB")
} else {
    print("setA is not a subset of setB")
}
```

In this example, `setA` is a subset of `setB` because all elements of `setA` are also present in `setB`.

## Checking Superset Relationship

To check if a set is a superset of another set, you can use the `isSuperset(of:)` method. This method returns a Boolean value indicating whether every element of the target set is also present in the calling set.

Here's an example:

```swift
let setC: Set<String> = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
let setD: Set<String> = ["apple", "banana"]

if setC.isSuperset(of: setD) {
    print("setC is a superset of setD")
} else {
    print("setC is not a superset of setD")
}
```

In this example, `setC` is a superset of `setD` because all elements of `setD` are also present in `setC`.

## Conclusion

Checking subset and superset relationships between sets can be done easily with the `isSubset(of:)` and `isSuperset(of:)` methods in Swift. These methods provide a convenient way to compare sets and determine their relationship to each other.
