Here's an example of how you can find the first element that satisfies a condition in a set in Swift:

```swift
let numbers: Set<Int> = [12, 25, 38, 41, 55, 63, 72]

if let firstEvenNumber = numbers.first(where: { $0 % 2 == 0 }) {
  print("The first even number in the set is \(firstEvenNumber)")
} else {
  print("No even numbers found in the set")
}
```

In the above example, we have a set of numbers and we want to find the first even number in the set. The `first(where:)` function takes a closure as an argument, which specifies the condition we want to satisfy. In this case, the closure checks if the number is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator.

If a matching element is found, it will be assigned to the `firstEvenNumber` constant and we can then use it for further processing. If no element satisfies the condition, the `first(where:)` function will return `nil`, and we can handle that case accordingly.

By using the `first(where:)` function on a set, you can efficiently find the first element that meets your specified condition, even without any defined order within the set.
