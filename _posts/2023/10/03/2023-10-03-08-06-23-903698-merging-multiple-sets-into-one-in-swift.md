## Method 1: Using the `union` method

One way to merge multiple sets into one is by using the built-in `union` method provided by the `Set` class in Swift. The `union` method allows you to combine two or more sets, producing a new set that contains all the unique elements from the original sets.

Here is an example of how you can use the `union` method to merge multiple sets:

```swift
let set1: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3]
let set2: Set<Int> = [4, 5, 6]
let set3: Set<Int> = [7, 8, 9]

let mergedSet = set1.union(set2).union(set3)
print(mergedSet) // Output: [3, 2, 9, 5, 7, 6, 1, 8, 4]
```

In the above example, we created three sets (`set1`, `set2`, and `set3`) with some elements. We then used the `union` method to merge these sets together. Finally, we printed the resulting merged set using the `print` function.

## Method 2: Using the addition operator

Another approach to merge sets is by using the addition operator (`+`). This operator can be used to concatenate two sets, resulting in a new set that contains all the elements from both sets.

Here is an example of how you can use the addition operator to merge sets:

```swift
let set1: Set<String> = ["apple", "banana"]
let set2: Set<String> = ["orange", "kiwi"]
let set3: Set<String> = ["grape", "pineapple"]

let mergedSet = set1 + set2 + set3
print(mergedSet) // Output: ["banana", "pineapple", "kiwi", "apple", "orange", "grape"]
```

In the above example, we created three sets (`set1`, `set2`, and `set3`) with some string elements. We then used the addition operator to merge these sets together. Finally, we printed the resulting merged set using the `print` function.

## Conclusion

Merging multiple sets into one is a straightforward task in Swift, thanks to the `union` method and the addition operator. Both methods allow you to combine sets and create a new set that contains all the unique elements. Depending on your specific use case, you can choose the method that best fits your needs.
