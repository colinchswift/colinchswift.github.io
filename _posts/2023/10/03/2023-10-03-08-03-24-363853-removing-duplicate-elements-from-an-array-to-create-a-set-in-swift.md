If you have an array in Swift that contains duplicate elements and you want to remove those duplicates to create a set, Swift provides a convenient way to achieve this. In Swift, a set is an unordered collection of unique values, which means it automatically removes any duplicate elements.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to convert an array into a set to remove duplicate elements:

```swift
let array = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7]
let set = Set(array)
```

In the above code, we have an array `array` that contains several duplicate elements. By using the `Set` initializer, we can convert the array into a set. After this conversion, the `set` variable will contain only the unique elements from the original array. In this case, the resulting set will be `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`.

It's important to note that when you convert an array into a set, the order of the elements may change since sets represent an unordered collection.

If you need to preserve the order of the elements while removing duplicates, you can use another approach. Here's an example code snippet that removes duplicate elements while preserving the order of the original array:

```swift
let array = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7]
var uniqueArray = [Int]()

for element in array {
    if !uniqueArray.contains(element) {
        uniqueArray.append(element)
    }
}
```

In the above code, we create an empty array `uniqueArray` to store the unique elements. We iterate over each element in the original array and check if it's already present in the `uniqueArray`. If it's not, we add it to the `uniqueArray`. By the end of the loop, `uniqueArray` will contain the unique elements of the original array while preserving the order.

By removing duplicate elements from an array, you can create a set in Swift for further operations or eliminate redundant data. Remember to choose the approach that best suits your requirements, depending on whether preserving the order is important or not.
