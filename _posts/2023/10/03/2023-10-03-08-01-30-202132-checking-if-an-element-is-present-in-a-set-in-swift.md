To check if an element is present in a set, you can use the `contains` method. Here's an example:

```swift
let fruits: Set<String> = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

if fruits.contains("banana") {
    print("Banana is present in the set")
} else {
    print("Banana is not present in the set")
}
```

In this example, we have a set called `fruits` that contains three string elements: "apple", "banana", and "orange". We can use the `contains` method to check if the set contains the string "banana". If it does, the message "Banana is present in the set" will be printed. Otherwise, the message "Banana is not present in the set" will be printed.

You can also use the `contains` method to check the presence of multiple elements by passing in a sequence of values. For example:

```swift
let numbers: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

if numbers.contains(where: [2, 4, 6].contains) {
    print("At least one of the numbers 2, 4, or 6 is present")
} else {
    print("None of the numbers 2, 4, or 6 is present")
}
```

In this example, we have a set called `numbers` that contains five integer elements. We use the `contains(where: )` method along with the closure `[2, 4, 6].contains` to check if any of the numbers 2, 4, or 6 is present in the set. If at least one of them is present, the message "At least one of the numbers 2, 4, or 6 is present" will be printed. Otherwise, the message "None of the numbers 2, 4, or 6 is present" will be printed.

By using the `contains` method, you can easily check if an element or multiple elements are present in a set in Swift. It provides a concise and efficient way to perform such checks.
