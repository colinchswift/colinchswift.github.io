In this blog post, we will explore how to combine the power of Combine, Apple's reactive programming framework, with Realm, a popular mobile database solution. By combining these two technologies, developers can build robust and reactive applications that leverage the benefits of both.

## What is Combine?

Combine is a framework introduced by Apple, starting from iOS 13, to provide a declarative way of handling asynchronous and event-driven programming. It allows developers to work with streams of values over time, also known as publishers, and provides a set of operators to transform and manipulate these values easily.

## What is Realm?

Realm is a mobile database solution that provides fast and efficient real-time data synchronization on various platforms, including iOS and macOS. It offers an easy-to-use API for persisting and querying data, making it an ideal choice for mobile app development.

## Combining Combine and Realm

Combining Combine and Realm can be a powerful combination for reactive programming and data persistence. Here are a few ways you can use them together:

### 1. Observing Realm Results with Combine

Realm provides an API for observing changes to query results using a `NotificationToken`. By leveraging Combine's `NotificationCenter.Publisher`, you can create a Combine publisher that emits Realm change notifications. This allows you to use Combine's powerful operators to transform and handle the observed changes.

```swift
import Combine
import RealmSwift

class ViewModel {
    @Published var realmResults: AnyPublisher<Results<Object>, Never> {
        Realm.asyncOpen(configuration: configuration) { (result) in
            // Handle Realm async open result
        }
        .compactMap { $0?.objects(Object.self) }
        .handleEvents(receiveOutput: { [weak self] _ in
            // Realm query results have been observed
        })
        .eraseToAnyPublisher()
    }
}
```
### 2. Using Combine for Network Operations and Realm Transactions

Combine can also be used to handle network requests using `URLSession.Publisher` and then persisting the received data in Realm within a transaction.

```swift
import Combine
import RealmSwift

func fetchDataAndPersist() {
    URLSession.shared.dataTaskPublisher(for: url)
        .map { $0.data }
        .decode(type: MyData.self, decoder: JSONDecoder())
        .handleEvents(receiveOutput: { myData in
            let realm = try! Realm()
            try! realm.write {
                realm.add(myData, update: .modified)
            }
        })
        .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
            // Handle completion
        }, receiveValue: { _ in
            // Handle received data
        })
        .store(in: &cancellables)
}
```

### 3. Combining Multiple Publishers with CombineLatest or Merge

With Combine, you can easily combine multiple publishers, such as network requests and Realm queries, using operators like `combineLatest` or `merge`. This allows you to create complex reactive pipelines that respond to changes in both network data and persisted data.

```swift
import Combine
import RealmSwift

func combinePublishers() {
    let networkRequestPublisher = URLSession.shared.dataTaskPublisher(for: url)
        .map { $0.data }
        .decode(type: MyData.self, decoder: JSONDecoder())

    let realmPublisher = Realm.asyncOpen(configuration: configuration)
        .compactMap { $0?.objects(Object.self) }

    Publishers
        .CombineLatest(networkRequestPublisher, realmPublisher)
        .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
            // Handle completion
        }, receiveValue: { networkData, realmData in
            // Handle received data from both publishers
        })
        .store(in: &cancellables)
}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to combine Combine and Realm to build reactive and persistent applications. By leveraging the power of Combine's reactive programming capabilities and Realm's efficient data synchronization, developers can create robust and responsive apps. 

Furthermore, combining Combine and Realm opens up new possibilities for handling complex data flows and maintaining a reactive architecture. Whether you need to observe Realm query results, perform network requests, or combine multiple publishers, the combination of Combine and Realm is a valuable tool in your development arsenal.
