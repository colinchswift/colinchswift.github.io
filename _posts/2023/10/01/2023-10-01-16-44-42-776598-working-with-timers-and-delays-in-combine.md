In Swift, Combine is a powerful framework for handling asynchronous and reactive programming. It provides a wide range of operators and publishers to handle various situations. One common requirement is working with timers and delays. In this blog post, we will explore how to work with timers and delays in Combine.

## Creating a Timer Publisher

To create a timer publisher in Combine, we can use the `Timer` class. The `Timer` class provides a variety of methods to create a timer that emits values on a specified time interval. Here's an example of creating a timer publisher that emits a value every second:

```swift
import Combine

let timerPublisher = Timer.publish(every: 1, on: .main, in: .common)
```

In the example above, we use the `publish` method of `Timer` to create a publisher that emits a value every second on the main run loop in the common mode. This publisher will emit a new value every second until it is canceled.

## Subscribing to a Timer Publisher

Once we have a timer publisher, we can subscribe to it and receive the emitted values. We use the `sink` operator to handle the emitted values:

```swift
let cancellable = timerPublisher.sink { date in
    print("Timer fired at \(date)")
}
```

In the example above, we use the `sink` operator to subscribe to the timer publisher and print the date when the timer fires.

## Creating a Delay Publisher

In addition to timers, Combine also provides a way to introduce delays in our code. We can use the `Deferred` operator combined with the `Just` publisher to introduce a delay in our pipeline. Here's an example of creating a delay publisher that emits a value after a specified time interval:

```swift
import Combine

let delayPublisher = Just("Hello")
    .delay(for: .seconds(2), scheduler: RunLoop.main)
```

In the example above, we use the `Just` publisher to create a publisher that emits a single value ("Hello"). We then use the `delay` operator to introduce a delay of 2 seconds on the main run loop.

## Subscribing to a Delay Publisher

Similar to the timer publisher, we can subscribe to the delay publisher and handle the emitted values. Here's an example:

```swift
let cancellable = delayPublisher.sink { message in
    print("Delayed message: \(message)")
}
```

In the example above, we use the `sink` operator to subscribe to the delay publisher and print the delayed message when it is emitted.

## Conclusion

Working with timers and delays in Combine provides us with the flexibility to handle asynchronous operations in a reactive way. By creating and subscribing to timer and delay publishers, we can easily integrate timers and delays into our Combine pipelines.
