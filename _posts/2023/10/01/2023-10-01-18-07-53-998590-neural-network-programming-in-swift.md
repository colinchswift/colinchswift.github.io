Neural networks are a powerful technique used in machine learning and artificial intelligence to solve complex problems. In this blog post, we will explore how to program a neural network using Swift.

## Setting up the Neural Network

To get started, we need to set up the basic structure of the neural network. We will use a framework called `Create ML` provided by Apple to create and train our neural network.

First, import the necessary framework:

```swift
import CreateML
```

Next, define the structure of your neural network. This includes the number of input nodes, hidden nodes, and output nodes:

```swift
let inputNodes = 2
let hiddenNodes = 4
let outputNodes = 1
```

## Training the Neural Network

Once we have set up the structure of our neural network, we need to train it using some data. Training a neural network involves providing it with labeled data and adjusting the weights and biases of the network to minimize its error.

To train our neural network, we need a dataset. Let's assume we have a dataset of XOR gate inputs and outputs:

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Output |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
|   0     |    0    |   0    |
|   0     |    1    |   1    |
|   1     |    0    |   1    |
|   1     |    1    |   0    |

We can perform the training using the `MLDataTable` class provided by `Create ML`:

```swift
let data: MLDataTable = // Load the dataset

let neuralNetwork = try MLNeuralNetwork(configuration: .init(inputFeatureNames: ["input1", "input2"], outputFeatureName: "output"))

let trainingParams = MLUpdateParameters(trainingData: data)

try neuralNetwork.update(using: data, parameters: trainingParams)
```

## Making Predictions with the Neural Network

Once the neural network is trained, we can use it to make predictions on new, unseen data. We can feed inputs to the network and get the corresponding outputs.

```swift
let inputs: [MLFeatureProvider] = // Provide the inputs

if let predictions = try? neuralNetwork.predictions(from: inputs) {
    for prediction in predictions {
        let output = prediction.featureValue(for: "output")?.int64Value
        print("Predicted output: \(output ?? -1)")
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to program a neural network in Swift using the `Create ML` framework. We set up the structure of the neural network, trained it using a dataset, and made predictions using new inputs. Neural networks are a powerful tool in machine learning, and Swift provides a convenient way to implement them.
