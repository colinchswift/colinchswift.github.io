Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. It can be valuable in various applications such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and market research. In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement sentiment analysis using the Combine framework in Swift.

## What is Combine?

Combine is a powerful framework introduced by Apple that simplifies handling asynchronous and event-based programming. It provides a declarative Swift API for processing asynchronous operations and handling events as streams of values. Combine makes it easier to work with asynchronous data flows and enables developers to handle complex asynchronous scenarios efficiently.

## Setting up the Project

Before we start implementing sentiment analysis, let's set up a new Swift project. Open Xcode and create a new Single View App project. Choose a suitable name and bundle identifier for your project.

## Integrating Natural Language Framework

Sentiment analysis relies on the Natural Language framework, which provides various capabilities for working with natural language in Swift. To integrate the Natural Language framework into your project, follow these steps:

1. Open your project's target settings by selecting the project file in the Xcode navigator and choosing the target.
2. Go to the "Build Phases" tab.
3. Expand the "Link Binary With Libraries" section.
4. Click the '+' button to add a new library.
5. Search for "NaturalLanguage.framework" and add it to your project.

## Performing Sentiment Analysis

Now that we have set up our project and integrated the Natural Language framework, let's proceed to implement sentiment analysis using Combine.

First, import the necessary frameworks and create a `NLTagger` instance:

```swift
import Combine
import NaturalLanguage

let tagger = NLTagger(tagSchemes: [.sentimentScore])
```

Next, define a function that takes a piece of text as input and returns a `Future` publisher with the sentiment score as the output:

```swift
func analyzeSentiment(text: String) -> Future<Double, Error> {
    return Future { promise in
        tagger.string = text
        tagger.enumerateTags(in: text.startIndex..<text.endIndex, unit: .paragraph, scheme: .sentimentScore) { (tag, tokenRange) -> Bool in
            if let sentiment = tag, let sentimentScore = Double(sentiment.rawValue) {
                promise(.success(sentimentScore))
            }
            return true
        }
    }
}
```

The `analyzeSentiment` function uses the `Future` type from the Combine framework to encapsulate the asynchronous operation of sentiment analysis. It sets the input text for the tagger and enumerates through the text's tags using the `.paragraph` unit. If a sentiment tag is found, it extracts the sentiment score and completes the promise of the `Future`.

Finally, you can use the `analyzeSentiment` function to perform sentiment analysis on a given text:

```swift
let text = "I love this product! It exceeded my expectations."
analyzeSentiment(text: text)
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
        if case let .failure(error) = completion {
            print("Sentiment analysis failed: \(error)")
        }
    }, receiveValue: { sentimentScore in
        if sentimentScore >= 0 {
            print("Positive sentiment")
        } else {
            print("Negative sentiment")
        }
    })
    .store(in: &subscriptions)
```

The code above subscribes to the `Future` publisher returned by the `analyzeSentiment` function. It handles the completion of the publisher and receives the sentiment score. Based on the sentiment score, it prints either positive or negative sentiment.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to implement sentiment analysis using the Combine framework in Swift. We integrated the Natural Language framework into our project and used the `NLTagger` class to perform sentiment analysis. Combine's powerful asynchronous programming capabilities allowed us to handle the asynchronous nature of sentiment analysis efficiently.
