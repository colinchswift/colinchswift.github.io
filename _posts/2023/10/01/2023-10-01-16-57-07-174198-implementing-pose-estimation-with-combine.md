Pose estimation, also known as skeleton tracking, is the process of estimating the position and orientation of a person's body joints in an image or video. It has applications in various fields such as augmented reality, sports analysis, and human-computer interaction.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement pose estimation using Combine, Apple's framework for handling asynchronous events in Swift. Combine provides powerful tools for working with streams of data and allows us to efficiently process video frames and extract pose information.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- Xcode 11.0+ installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of Swift programming language.
- Familiarity with Combine framework.

## Setting Up the Project

1. Create a new Swift project in Xcode.
2. Add the Combine framework to your project by navigating to **Project ➞ Targets ➞ Your Project Name ➞ General ➞ Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**. Click the "+" button and select Combine.framework.

## Capturing Video Frames

We need to capture video frames from a video source in order to perform pose estimation. We can use AVFoundation to access the camera and retrieve the frames.

```swift
import AVFoundation
import Combine

class VideoCapture {
    let session = AVCaptureSession()
    let videoOutput = AVCaptureVideoDataOutput()

    private var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()

    func start() {
        guard let device = AVCaptureDevice.default(for: .video),
              let input = try? AVCaptureDeviceInput(device: device)
        else { return }

        session.addInput(input)
        session.addOutput(videoOutput)
        session.startRunning()

        videoOutput.setSampleBufferDelegate(self, queue: DispatchQueue(label: "VideoDataOutputQueue"))
    }
}

extension VideoCapture: AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate {
    func captureOutput(_ output: AVCaptureOutput, didOutput sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, from connection: AVCaptureConnection) {
        // Process the sample buffer and extract pose information using pose estimation algorithm
    }
}
```

In the `start()` method, we configure the AVCaptureSession, add the video input and output, and start running the session. The `captureOutput(_:didOutput:from:)` method is called when a video frame is outputted from the session.

## Processing Video Frames

Now that we have access to the video frames, we can process them to extract pose information. There are several pose estimation algorithms available, such as OpenPose and PoseNet. For simplicity, let's assume we have a function called `estimatePose` that takes in a `CMSampleBuffer` object and returns the estimated pose.

```swift
func estimatePose(from sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer) -> AnyPublisher<Pose, Error> {
    return Future<Pose, Error> { promise in
        // Call the pose estimation algorithm and pass the sample buffer to get the pose estimation result

        if let pose = /* Processed pose object */, let confidence = /* Confidence of the estimation */ {
            promise(.success(Pose(pose: pose, confidence: confidence)))
        } else {
            promise(.failure(PoseEstimationError.estimationFailed))
        }
    }.eraseToAnyPublisher()
}
```

The `estimatePose` function returns a `AnyPublisher<Pose, Error>` to represent the result of the pose estimation. We use the `Future` type from Combine to create an async operation that either succeeds with a pose object or fails with an error.

## Combining Video Capture and Pose Estimation

To combine the video capture and pose estimation, we can use Combine's operators to process the video frames and obtain the pose estimation results.

```swift
class PoseEstimationManager {
    let videoCapture = VideoCapture()
    
    private var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()

    func start() {
        videoCapture.start()

        videoCapture.videoOutput
            .publisher
            .compactMap { [weak self] sampleBuffer in
                self?.estimatePose(from: sampleBuffer)
            }
            .sink { poseResult in
                // Process the pose estimation result
            }
            .store(in: &cancellables)
    }
}
```

In the `start()` method of `PoseEstimationManager`, we start the video capture. Then, we use the `publisher` property of `videoOutput` to obtain a Combine publisher that emits each captured sample buffer. We use the `compactMap` operator to call the `estimatePose` function on each emitted sample buffer and filter out any nil results.

Finally, we use the `sink` operator to receive the pose estimation result and perform further processing or analysis. The result can be used to overlay skeleton lines on the captured video, track specific joints, or perform any other desired actions.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have explored how to implement pose estimation using Combine in a Swift project. By combining video capture with pose estimation algorithms, we can extract pose information from video frames and use it for various applications.

Combining Combine's powerful asynchronous processing capabilities with pose estimation techniques opens up a wide range of possibilities for developers to leverage in their own projects.
