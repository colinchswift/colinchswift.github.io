In this tutorial, we will explore how to integrate 3D Touch into your Swift application by adding quick actions and shortcuts to enhance the user experience. **3D Touch** is a feature available on newer iPhone models that allows users to interact with their device through pressure-sensitive gestures.

## Quick Actions

Quick actions provide users with shortcut options to perform actions within your app without launching it fully. These options appear when the user presses firmly on the app icon on the home screen.

To add quick actions to your app, follow these steps:

**Step 1**: Enable 3D Touch in your Xcode project. Open your project settings, go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab, and enable the "Enable 3D Touch" option.

**Step 2**: Define the quick actions in your app's `Info.plist` file. Open the `Info.plist` file, right-click in the blank space, and select "Add Row". Set the `UIApplicationShortcutItems` as an array, and add dictionaries for each quick action.

**Step 3**: Each quick action dictionary should contain the following keys:
- `UIApplicationShortcutItemTitle`: The title of the quick action.
- `UIApplicationShortcutItemType`: A unique identifier for the quick action.
- `UIApplicationShortcutItemIconFile`: The name of the icon file for the quick action (optional).

**Step 4**: Implement the quick actions in your app delegate. Open your app delegate file, and override the `application(_:performActionFor:completionHandler:)` method. Inside this method, you can handle the different quick action types based on their identifiers.

Here is an example of how to implement quick actions in Swift:

```swift
// Step 4: Implement the quick actions in the app delegate

func application(_ application: UIApplication, performActionFor shortcutItem: UIApplicationShortcutItem, completionHandler: @escaping (Bool) -> Void) {
    guard let shortcutIdentifier = shortcutItem.type.components(separatedBy: ".").last else {
        completionHandler(false)
        return
    }

    switch shortcutIdentifier {
    case "QuickAction1":
        // Handle Quick Action 1
        completionHandler(true)
    case "QuickAction2":
        // Handle Quick Action 2
        completionHandler(true)
    default:
        completionHandler(false)
    }
}
```

## Shortcuts

Shortcuts allow users to interact with specific parts of your app directly from the spotlight search or Siri. They provide more functionality than quick actions and can be customized based on user preferences. 

To add shortcuts to your app, follow these steps:

**Step 1**: Create a new target for the shortcuts. Go to your Xcode project settings, select your app target, and click the "+" button under "Targets". Select "Intent App Extension" and add a name for your extension.

**Step 2**: Define the shortcuts in your target extension. Open the `Intents.intentdefinition` file, right-click in the blank space, and add a new intent. Define the properties and actions for your intent.

**Step 3**: Implement the intent handler in your target extension. Open the intent handler file and override the necessary methods to handle user interactions with the defined shortcuts.

Here is an example of how to implement shortcuts in Swift:

```swift
// Step 3: Implement the intent handler in the target extension

import Intents

class ShortcutIntentHandler: NSObject, ExampleIntentHandling {

    func handle(intent: ExampleIntent, completion: @escaping (ExampleIntentResponse) -> Void) {
        if intent.shortcutType == "Shortcut1" {
            // Handle Shortcut 1
            completion(ExampleIntentResponse.success)
        } else if intent.shortcutType == "Shortcut2" {
            // Handle Shortcut 2
            completion(ExampleIntentResponse.success)
        } else {
            completion(ExampleIntentResponse.failure)
        }
    }

}
```

To summarize, integrating 3D Touch into your Swift app can provide users with quick actions and shortcuts to enhance their experience. By following these steps, you can easily add these features to your app and provide users with convenient ways to interact with your application without launching it fully.
