Enumerations, or enums, are a powerful feature in Swift that allow you to define a group of related values. Enums can have associated values, raw values, and can be used in switch statements for pattern matching. In this article, we will explore the syntax and usage of enums in Swift.

## Syntax

The syntax to define an enum in Swift is as follows:

```swift
enum MyEnum {
    case value1
    case value2
    case value3
    // ...
}
```

You can define as many cases as needed within the enum. Each case stands for a distinct value that the enum can take. For example, if we define an enum for the days of the week:

```swift
enum Day {
    case monday
    case tuesday
    case wednesday
    case thursday
    case friday
    case saturday
    case sunday
}
```

## Usage

Once you have defined an enum, you can use it to declare variables, constants, or function parameters of that type. For example, to declare a variable of type `Day`, you would write:

```swift
var today: Day = .monday
```

You can access the value of an enum case using dot notation. For example:

```swift
print(today) // Output: monday
```

## Associated Values

Enums in Swift can have associated values, which allow you to attach additional data to each case. This is useful when you need to store different values for different cases. For example, let's define an enum to represent different types of vehicles:

```swift
enum Vehicle {
    case car(brand: String)
    case truck(maxLoad: Double)
    case motorcycle(hasHelmet: Bool)
}
```

In the above example, the `car` case has an associated value of type `String`, representing the brand of the car. The `truck` case has an associated value of type `Double`, representing the maximum load it can carry. The `motorcycle` case has an associated value of type `Bool`, representing whether it has a helmet or not.

You can create instances of the `Vehicle` enum and access the associated values like this:

```swift
let myCar = Vehicle.car(brand: "Tesla")
let truck = Vehicle.truck(maxLoad: 5000.0)
let myBike = Vehicle.motorcycle(hasHelmet: true)

switch myCar {
case .car(let brand):
    print("I drive a \(brand).")
case .truck(let maxLoad):
    print("I own a truck that can carry up to \(maxLoad) kg.")
case .motorcycle(let hasHelmet):
    print("I ride a motorcycle and \(hasHelmet ? "have" : "don't have") a helmet.")
}
```

## Raw Values

Enums in Swift can also have raw values, which are predefined values that are assigned to each case. The raw values must all be of the same type. Raw values are useful when you need to assign a constant value to each case. For example:

```swift
enum Planet: String {
    case mercury = "Mercury"
    case venus = "Venus"
    case earth = "Earth"
    case mars = "Mars"
}
```

In the above example, each case in the `Planet` enum has a raw value of type `String`. You can access the raw value of an enum case using the `rawValue` property. For example:

```swift
let earth = Planet.earth
print(earth.rawValue) // Output: Earth
```

## Conclusion

Enums in Swift provide a powerful way to define and work with a group of related values. They can have associated values and raw values, making them versatile and flexible. Whether you need to represent a set of options or model real-world entities, enums are a great tool to have in your Swift toolbox.
