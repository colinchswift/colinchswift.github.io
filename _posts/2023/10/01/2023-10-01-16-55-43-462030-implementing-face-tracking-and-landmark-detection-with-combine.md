In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement face tracking and landmark detection using Combine. Combine is a powerful framework introduced by Apple for handling asynchronous and event-based programming. We will leverage Combine's capabilities to perform real-time face tracking and landmark detection using Vision framework.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need:

1. Xcode 11.0 or later
2. An iOS device with a front-facing camera (or you can use the simulator)

## Step 1: Setup the Project

Start by creating a new Xcode project. Choose the "Single View App" template and provide the necessary details.

## Step 2: Import the Required Frameworks

We need to import the following frameworks to enable face tracking and landmark detection:

```swift
import Combine
import AVFoundation
import Vision
```

## Step 3: Configure the Video Capture Session

In order to track faces and detect landmarks, we need to capture live video frames from the camera. Add the following code to configure the video capture session:

```swift
// Create a video capture session
let captureSession = AVCaptureSession()

// Configure the session to capture video
guard let captureDevice = AVCaptureDevice.default(for: .video),
      let input = try? AVCaptureDeviceInput(device: captureDevice) else { return }

captureSession.addInput(input)
captureSession.startRunning()

// Create a video data output
let videoOutput = AVCaptureVideoDataOutput()
videoOutput.setSampleBufferDelegate(self, queue: DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInteractive))

captureSession.addOutput(videoOutput)
```

Ensure that your view controller adopts the `AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate` protocol.

## Step 4: Setup Face Tracking and Landmark Detection

Now, we will use Vision framework to enable face tracking and landmark detection. Add the following code to configure the Vision requests:

```swift
// Create a request handler
let requestHandler = VNSequenceRequestHandler()

// Create a face detection request
let faceDetectionRequest = VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest { (request, error) in
    // Handle face detection results
}

// Setup tracking level to ensure smooth face tracking
faceDetectionRequest.revision = VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequestRevision2

// Setup the face tracking sequence
var trackingSequence = VNSequenceRequestHandler()
trackingSequence.setDelegate(self, queue: DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInteractive))

// Perform face detection and tracking on each video frame
func captureOutput(_ output: AVCaptureOutput, didOutput sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, from connection: AVCaptureConnection) {
    guard let pixelBuffer = CMSampleBufferGetImageBuffer(sampleBuffer) else { return }

    do {
        try trackingSequence.perform([faceDetectionRequest], on: pixelBuffer)
    } catch {
        // Handle error
    }
}
```

Ensure that your view controller adopts the `VNSequenceRequestHandlerDelegate` protocol.

## Step 5: Handle Face Detection and Landmark Tracking Results

Finally, we need to handle the results of the face detection and landmark tracking requests. Add the following code to process the results:

```swift
func sequenceRequestHandler(_ requestHandler: VNSequenceRequestHandler, didFailWithError error: Error) {
    // Handle error
}

func sequenceRequestHandler(_ requestHandler: VNSequenceRequestHandler, didFinishSequence sequence: VNSequenceRequest? = nil, error: Error?) {
    // Handle sequence completion
}

func handleFaceObservation(_ observation: VNFaceObservation) {
    // Process face observation
}

func handleLandmarks(_ landmarks: VNFaceLandmarks2D) {
    // Process landmark detection
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to implement face tracking and landmark detection using Combine. We integrated AVFoundation for capturing live video frames and utilized the Vision framework for face detection and landmark tracking. Combine's powerful event handling capabilities made it easy to perform real-time face tracking. You can now explore further and enhance your app's capabilities by leveraging these techniques.
