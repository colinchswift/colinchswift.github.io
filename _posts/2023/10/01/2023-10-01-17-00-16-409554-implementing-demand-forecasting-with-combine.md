Demand forecasting is a crucial aspect of supply chain management, helping businesses make informed decisions about production, procurement, and inventory management. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement demand forecasting using Combine, an Apple framework that provides a declarative approach to working with asynchronous events and data streams.

## Why Combine?

Combine is a powerful framework in the Apple ecosystem that allows developers to handle asynchronous operations and data streams in a manageable and maintainable way. It combines reactive programming and functional programming concepts, making it a great choice for implementing demand forecasting.

## Importing Combine

To begin, make sure you import the Combine framework into your project:

```swift
import Combine
```

## Data Preparation

Before we start forecasting, we need to gather historical sales data. This data will serve as the basis for our forecasting model. The data can be obtained from sales records or any other relevant source.

Let's assume we have a CSV file containing historical sales data. To fetch the data and convert it into a usable format, we can use the following code:

```swift
func fetchData() -> AnyPublisher<[Sale], Error> {
    return URLSession.shared.dataTaskPublisher(for: URL(string: "https://example.com/sales.csv")!)
        .tryMap { (data, _) -> Data in
            guard let responseString = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) else {
                throw MyError.invalidData
            }
            return responseString.data(using: .utf8)!
        }
        .decode(type: [Sale].self, decoder: JSONDecoder())
        .eraseToAnyPublisher()
}
```

In the above code, we use Combine's `dataTaskPublisher(for:)` function to fetch the CSV data from a URL. We then convert the received data into a String and finally decode it into an array of `Sale` objects using JSONDecoder.

## Forecasting with Machine Learning

Once we have our historical sales data, we can use machine learning techniques to forecast future demand. Apple's Core ML framework integrates well with Combine, allowing us to train models and make predictions.

```swift
func forecastDemand(sales: [Sale]) -> AnyPublisher<Float, Error> {
    return Future { promise in
        // Perform demand forecasting using machine learning techniques
        // ...
        let forecastedDemand = 500.0 // Example forecast result
        promise(.success(forecastedDemand))
    }
    .eraseToAnyPublisher()
}
```

In the above code, we use Combine's `Future` to encapsulate the demand forecasting logic. Inside the closure, you can implement your custom machine learning algorithms or use pre-trained models to predict future demand. The forecasted demand is then returned as a `Future` result.

## Subscribing to the Forecast

To receive the forecasted demand, we need to subscribe to the publisher returned by `forecastDemand(sales:)`. Here's an example of how you can consume the forecasted demand:

```swift
fetchData()
    .flatMap { sales in
        forecastDemand(sales: sales)
    }
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { completion in
            switch completion {
            case .failure(let error):
                print("Failed to forecast demand: \(error)")
            case .finished:
                print("Demand forecasting completed")
            }
        },
        receiveValue: { demand in
            print("Forecasted demand: \(demand)")
        }
    )
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

In the above code, we chain the `fetchData()` and `forecastDemand(sales:)` publishers using `flatMap`. Then, we subscribe to the resulting publisher using `sink`, providing closures to handle both completion and value events. The `cancellables` property is used to store the subscription for later cancellation.

## Conclusion

Implementing demand forecasting with Combine provides a solid foundation for leveraging data streams and asynchronous operations. By combining the power of Combine and machine learning, businesses can make accurate predictions about future demand, enabling efficient planning and decision-making.
