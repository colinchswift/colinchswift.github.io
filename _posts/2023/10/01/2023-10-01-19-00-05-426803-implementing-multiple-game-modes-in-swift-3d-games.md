Games become more engaging and immersive when they offer multiple gameplay modes. Whether it's a story mode, time trial, or multiplayer mode, giving players different ways to experience the game adds depth and replayability. In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement multiple game modes in Swift 3D games.

## Steps to Implement Multiple Game Modes

### 1. Define Game Modes

First, you need to define the different game modes you want to include in your game. For example, let's say you want to have a Story mode and an Endless mode. Create an enumeration in your code to represent the game modes:

```swift
enum GameMode {
    case story
    case endless
}
```

### 2. Handle Game Mode Selection

Next, you need to provide a way for the player to select the game mode. This can be done through a menu or a settings screen. Here's an example of how you can implement a simple game mode selection menu using SwiftUI:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct GameModeSelectionView: View {
    @State private var gameMode: GameMode = .story
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Select Game Mode")
                .font(.title)
                .padding()
            
            Button(action: {
                gameMode = .story
                // Start game in Story mode
            }) {
                Text("Story Mode")
                    .font(.headline)
                    .padding()
            }
            
            Button(action: {
                gameMode = .endless
                // Start game in Endless mode
            }) {
                Text("Endless Mode")
                    .font(.headline)
                    .padding()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Update Game Logic Based on Game Mode

Once the player selects a game mode, you need to update the game logic accordingly. This could involve changes in level design, scoring, power-ups, or enemy behavior. For example, in the Story mode, you might have a predefined sequence of levels, while in the Endless mode, levels are procedurally generated.

Create different implementations for the game logic based on the selected game mode. You can use conditionals or switch statements to handle different game modes. Here's an example:

```swift
func updateGameLogic() {
    switch gameMode {
    case .story:
        // Update game logic for Story mode
        break
    case .endless:
        // Update game logic for Endless mode
        break
    }
}
```

### 4. Save and Load Game Mode

To offer the player the ability to continue playing in the selected game mode, you need to save and load the game mode. You can use UserDefaults or other persistent storage mechanisms to store the selected game mode, and then retrieve it when the game starts.

```swift
func saveGameMode() {
    UserDefaults.standard.set(gameMode, forKey: "GameMode")
}

func loadGameMode() -> GameMode {
    return UserDefaults.standard.object(forKey: "GameMode") as? GameMode ?? .story
}
```

### 5. Show Current Game Mode

Finally, you can display the current game mode to the player. This could be done in the main menu or in the in-game HUD. For example:

```swift
Text("Current Game Mode: \(gameMode)")
    .font(.headline)
    .padding()
```

## Conclusion

Implementing multiple game modes in Swift 3D games adds variety and enhances the player's experience. By defining game modes, handling game mode selection, updating game logic based on the game mode, saving and loading the game mode, and displaying the current game mode, you can create a more immersive and engaging game. Get creative and experiment with different game modes to keep your players entertained!
