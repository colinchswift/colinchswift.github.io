With the introduction of Combine in iOS 13, developers now have a powerful framework for handling asynchronous and event-driven programming. One practical use case for Combine is implementing location tracking in your app. In this blog post, we will explore how to leverage Combine to track the user's location in real-time.

## Getting Started

To begin, make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the user's location. In the **Info.plist** file, add the **NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription** key and provide a message that explains why your app needs access to the user's location.

## Initializing the Location Manager

First, import the *CoreLocation* and *Combine* frameworks to your project. Then, create an instance of the `CLLocationManager` and request authorization from the user.

```swift
import CoreLocation
import Combine

let locationManager = CLLocationManager()

func requestLocationAuthorization() {
    locationManager.requestWhenInUseAuthorization()
}
```

## Subscribing to Location Updates

Next, we'll define a `PassthroughSubject` that will emit updates whenever the user's location changes.

```swift
let locationUpdatePublisher = PassthroughSubject<CLLocation, Error>()

locationManager.delegate = self
locationManager.startUpdatingLocation()

func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) {
    if let location = locations.last {
        locationUpdatePublisher.send(location)
    }
}
```

The `locationManager(_:didUpdateLocations:)` method will be called each time the user's location is updated. We'll utilize the `PassthroughSubject` to emit the latest location to any subscribers.

## Subscribing to the Location Publisher

Now that we have our location updates, we can subscribe to the `locationUpdatePublisher` to receive the user's location in real-time.

```swift
locationUpdatePublisher
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
        switch completion {
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Location tracking error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        case .finished:
            break
        }
    }, receiveValue: { location in
        print("Received new location: \(location.coordinate.latitude), \(location.coordinate.longitude)")
    })
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

In this example, we're simply printing the received location. However, you can take any desired action based on the new location data you receive.

## Handling Errors

If there are any errors during location tracking, such as denied authorization or disabled location services, you can handle them within the `sink(receiveCompletion:receiveValue:)` closure.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we've explored how to implement location tracking using Combine. By leveraging the power of Combine, you can easily handle location updates and react to them in real-time. Make sure to experiment with different Combine operators and adapt the code to suit your specific needs. Happy coding!
