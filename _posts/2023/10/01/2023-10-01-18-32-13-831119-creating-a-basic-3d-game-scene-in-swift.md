In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a basic 3D game scene using Swift. We will use the SceneKit framework, which is a high-level framework provided by Apple for rendering 3D graphics.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Xcode installed on your machine
- Basic knowledge of Swift programming language

## Setting Up the Project

1. Open Xcode and create a new project.
2. Select "App" as the project template.
3. Choose a name for your project and set the language to Swift.
4. Select a location to save your project and click "Create".

## Adding SceneKit to the Project

1. In the Project Navigator, locate the file `ViewController.swift` and open it.
2. Add the following import statement at the top of the file to import the SceneKit framework:

```swift
import SceneKit
```
3. Replace the content of the `viewDidLoad()` method with the following code:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    
    // Create a SceneKit view
    let sceneView = SCNView(frame: view.bounds)
    sceneView.autoresizingMask = [.flexibleWidth, .flexibleHeight]
    view.addSubview(sceneView)
    
    // Create a scene
    let scene = SCNScene()
    sceneView.scene = scene
    
    // Set the scene's background color
    sceneView.backgroundColor = .black
    
    // Create a camera and add it to the scene
    let cameraNode = SCNNode()
    cameraNode.camera = SCNCamera()
    scene.rootNode.addChildNode(cameraNode)
    
    // Position the camera
    cameraNode.position = SCNVector3(x: 0, y: 0, z: 5)
    
    // Create a box geometry
    let box = SCNBox(width: 1, height: 1, length: 1, chamferRadius: 0)
    
    // Create a material for the box
    let material = SCNMaterial()
    material.diffuse.contents = UIColor.red
    box.materials = [material]
    
    // Create a node for the box and add it to the scene
    let boxNode = SCNNode(geometry: box)
    scene.rootNode.addChildNode(boxNode)
    
    // Animate the rotation of the box
    let rotate = SCNAction.rotateBy(x: 0, y: .pi, z: 0, duration: 1)
    let repeatAction = SCNAction.repeatForever(rotate)
    boxNode.runAction(repeatAction)
    
    // Set the scene to the view
    sceneView.scene = scene
}
```

## Running the Project

1. Build and run the project by clicking the "Build and Run" button or using the shortcut `Cmd + R`.
2. You should see a 3D scene with a rotating red box.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to create a basic 3D game scene using Swift and the SceneKit framework. We set up the project, added SceneKit to it, and created a 3D scene with a rotating box. This is just the beginning; from here, you can explore more advanced features of SceneKit and create more complex game scenes.
