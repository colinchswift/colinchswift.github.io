With the advent of Combine in iOS, implementing audio and video playback has become even more powerful. Combine is a framework introduced by Apple, which allows you to work with asynchronous events and data streams in a more streamlined and declarative manner. In this blog post, we will explore how Combine can be used to implement audio and video playback in your iOS applications.

## Setting up the Media Player ##

The first step in implementing audio and video playback is setting up the media player. Apple provides a framework called AVFoundation that can be used to work with media files. To set up the media player using Combine, you can create an instance of `AVPlayer` and wrap it in a `PassthroughSubject` to represent a data stream that emits events.

```swift
import AVFoundation
import Combine

class MediaPlayer {
    var player: AVPlayer = AVPlayer()
    var playbackPublisher = PassthroughSubject<Float, Never>()
    
    init() {
        // Setup player and observer for playback events
        setupPlayer()
        setupPlaybackObserver()
    }
    
    private func setupPlayer() {
        // Setup player with media file
        if let mediaURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "example", withExtension: "mp4") {
            let playerItem = AVPlayerItem(url: mediaURL)
            player.replaceCurrentItem(with: playerItem)
        }
    }
    
    private func setupPlaybackObserver() {
        // Observe the timeControlStatus of the player
        player.publisher(for: \.timeControlStatus)
            .sink { [weak self] status in
                if status == .playing {
                    self?.playbackPublisher.send(1.0)
                } else if status == .paused {
                    self?.playbackPublisher.send(0.0)
                }
            }
            .store(in: &cancellables)
    }
    
    // Other methods for controlling playback, such as play(), pause(), etc.
}
```

In the above code snippet, we have created a `MediaPlayer` class which encapsulates the setup and control of AVPlayer. The `playbackPublisher` is a `PassthroughSubject` that emits the playback progress as a float value between 0.0 and 1.0. We observe the `timeControlStatus` of the player and send the corresponding playback value through the `playbackPublisher`. This will allow us to easily monitor and control the playback status of the media.

## Subscribing to Playback Events ##

To subscribe to the playback events emitted by the media player, you can use the `sink` operator provided by Combine. This operator allows you to receive streamed events and perform actions based on those events. Here's an example of how you can subscribe to the playback events and update a progress view:

```swift
import Combine
import UIKit

class PlayerViewController: UIViewController {
    @IBOutlet weak var progressView: UIProgressView!
    var mediaPlayer = MediaPlayer()
    var playbackCancellable: AnyCancellable?
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        playbackCancellable = mediaPlayer.playbackPublisher
            .sink { [weak self] progress in
                self?.progressView.progress = progress
            }
    }
    
    // Other methods for controlling playback UI, such as playButtonTapped(), pauseButtonTapped(), etc.
}
```

In the above code snippet, we create an instance of `MediaPlayer` and subscribe to the `playbackPublisher` using the `sink` operator. Inside the closure, we update the `progressView` based on the received playback progress. You can add additional logic to handle other playback events such as play, pause, stop, etc. as needed.

## Conclusion ##

Using Combine to implement audio and video playback in your iOS applications brings a more streamlined and declarative approach to working with asynchronous events and data streams. The `AVPlayer` combined with `PassthroughSubject` allows you to easily control playback and receive events as they occur. By leveraging Combine, you can create powerful media playback features while keeping your code clean and maintainable.
