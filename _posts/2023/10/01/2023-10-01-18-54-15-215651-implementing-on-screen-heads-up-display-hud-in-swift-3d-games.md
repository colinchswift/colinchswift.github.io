When it comes to creating immersive and engaging 3D games in Swift, it's important to provide players with key information during gameplay. One effective way of doing this is through an on-screen heads-up display (HUD). A HUD is an overlay that displays important game-related information such as score, health, ammo, and more.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement a basic HUD in a Swift 3D game using the SceneKit framework. SceneKit is a powerful tool for building 3D applications and games on Apple platforms.

## Setting up the Scene

First, we need to set up our SceneKit scene. Start by creating a new project in Xcode and selecting the "Game" template. Choose "SceneKit" as the game technology.

Next, open the `GameViewController.swift` file and locate the `viewDidLoad()` method. Inside this method, remove the existing code and replace it with the following:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    // Create the scene
    let scene = SCNScene(named: "GameScene.scn")!

    // Configure the view
    let scnView = view as! SCNView
    scnView.scene = scene

    // Show statistics such as FPS and timing information
    scnView.showsStatistics = true

    // Enable default lighting
    scnView.autoenablesDefaultLighting = true
}
```

This code sets up the SceneKit scene using the provided `GameScene.scn` file, configures the view, and enables some useful features like statistics and default lighting.

## Adding HUD Elements

Now that we have our scene set up, let's start adding HUD elements. Create a new Swift file called `HUDNode.swift` and add the following code:

```swift
import SceneKit

class HUDNode: SCNNode {

    override init() {
        super.init()

        // Create HUD elements
        let scoreLabel = createHUDLabel(text: "Score: 0")
        scoreLabel.position = SCNVector3(x: 0, y: 0, z: -5)
        addChildNode(scoreLabel)

        let healthLabel = createHUDLabel(text: "Health: 100%")
        healthLabel.position = SCNVector3(x: 0, y: 30, z: -5)
        addChildNode(healthLabel)
    }

    required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {
        fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
    }

    private func createHUDLabel(text: String) -> SCNNode {
        let textGeometry = SCNText(string: text, extrusionDepth: 0)
        textGeometry.font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 12.0)
        textGeometry.flatness = 0.1

        let textNode = SCNNode(geometry: textGeometry)
        textNode.scale = SCNVector3(x: 0.02, y: 0.02, z: 0.02)

        return textNode
    }

}
```

This `HUDNode` class extends `SCNNode` and acts as a parent node for our HUD elements. In the `init()` method, we create two labels - one for the score and one for the health. We position them in 3D space and add them as child nodes to the HUD node.

The `createHUDLabel(text:)` method is a helper function that creates and configures a label node using an `SCNText` geometry. The label's font, size, and position are set to create a visually pleasing HUD.

## Attaching the HUD to the Scene

Now that we have our `HUDNode` defined, we need to attach it to our scene. Open the `GameViewController.swift` file again and add the following code at the bottom of the `viewDidLoad()` method:

```swift
// Create the HUD
let hudNode = HUDNode()
hudNode.position = SCNVector3(x: 0, y: 0, z: -10)
scene.rootNode.addChildNode(hudNode)
```

This code creates an instance of `HUDNode` and positions it in front of the camera by setting its `z` position to -10. We then add the HUD node as a child node to the scene's root node.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to implement an on-screen heads-up display (HUD) in Swift 3D games using the SceneKit framework. We created a `HUDNode` class as a parent node for our HUD elements and added it to our SceneKit scene.

Implementing a HUD in your 3D games can greatly enhance the player experience by providing important game-related information. Feel free to experiment and customize the HUD to suit your game's specific needs and design.
