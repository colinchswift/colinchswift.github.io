Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on creating objects that encapsulate data and behavior. Swift, Apple's programming language, fully supports OOP principles, making it a powerful language for building robust and scalable applications. In this blog post, we will explore the key OOP concepts in Swift.

## 1. Classes and Objects

In Swift, a class is used to define the blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that an object can have. Objects are instances of a class, and they encapsulate all the data and behavior defined in the class.

```swift
class Car {
    var brand: String
    var price: Double
    
    init(brand: String, price: Double) {
        self.brand = brand
        self.price = price
    }
    
    func startEngine() {
        print("Engine started!")
    }
}

let myCar = Car(brand: "Tesla", price: 50000)
myCar.startEngine()
```

In this example, we define a `Car` class with `brand` and `price` properties, and a `startEngine()` method. We then create an instance of the `Car` class called `myCar` and call the `startEngine()` method on it.

## 2. Inheritance

Inheritance is a powerful feature in OOP that allows us to create new classes based on existing classes. The new class inherits all the properties and methods of the existing class and can add its own additional properties and methods.

```swift
class ElectricCar: Car {
    var range: Double
    
    init(brand: String, price: Double, range: Double) {
        self.range = range
        super.init(brand: brand, price: price)
    }
    
    override func startEngine() {
        print("Electric engine started!")
    }
}

let myElectricCar = ElectricCar(brand: "Tesla", price: 70000, range: 300)
myElectricCar.startEngine()
```

In this example, we define an `ElectricCar` class that inherits from the `Car` class. It adds an additional `range` property and overrides the `startEngine()` method to provide a different implementation. We then create an instance of the `ElectricCar` class called `myElectricCar` and call the `startEngine()` method on it.

## 3. Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of the same superclass. This enables code to be written in a more generic way, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.

```swift
func startCarsEngines(_ cars: [Car]) {
    for car in cars {
        car.startEngine()
    }
}

let myCars: [Car] = [myCar, myElectricCar]
startCarsEngines(myCars)
```

In this example, we define a function `startCarsEngines(_:)` that accepts an array of `Car` objects. We iterate over the array and call the `startEngine()` method on each object, regardless of whether it's a `Car` or `ElectricCar`. This demonstrates polymorphism, as both types of objects can be treated as objects of the `Car` superclass.

## Conclusion

Object-oriented programming concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism are fundamental to building scalable and modular applications in Swift. By leveraging these concepts, you can write clean and efficient code that promotes code reusability and maintainability.
