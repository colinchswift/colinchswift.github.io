Combine is Apple's framework for working with asynchronous events and data streams in Swift. It provides a powerful set of operators that allow you to manipulate and transform these data streams in various ways. In this blog post, we'll explore some of the most commonly used operators in Combine.

## Filter

The `filter` operator allows you to selectively pass or drop elements from a data stream based on a given condition. It takes a closure as its argument, which gets called for each element in the stream. If the closure's return value is `true`, the element is passed through; otherwise, it is dropped.

**Example:**

```swift
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
let filtered = numbers.publisher.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }
filtered.sink { print($0) }
```

In this example, we have an array of numbers and we filter out only the even numbers using the `filter` operator. The resulting stream will only contain the numbers 2, 4, 6, and 8.

## Map

The `map` operator allows you to transform each element in a data stream into a new value based on a given transformation closure. It takes a closure as its argument, which gets called for each element in the stream. The closure's return value becomes the new value emitted by the stream.

**Example:**

```swift
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let mapped = numbers.publisher.map { $0 * 2 }
mapped.sink { print($0) }
```

In this example, we have an array of numbers and we multiply each number by 2 using the `map` operator. The resulting stream will emit the doubled values: 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.

## Conclusion

These are just a few examples of the operators available in Combine. By combining these operators together, you can create powerful and expressive transformations on your data streams. Whether you need to filter, map, merge, or combine streams, Combine has you covered with its extensive operator library.
