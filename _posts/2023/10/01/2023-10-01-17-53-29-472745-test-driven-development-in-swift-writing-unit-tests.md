In this blog post, we will explore how to write unit tests in Swift using XCTest, Apple's testing framework. Unit tests are a fundamental part of TDD as they help ensure that each individual component of your code behaves as expected. Let's dive in!

To get started with unit testing in Swift, create a new Xcode project or open an existing one. Then, follow these steps:

1. Create a new test class:

   ```swift
   import XCTest

   class MyModuleTests: XCTestCase {

       // Tests go here

   }
   ```

2. Write test methods:
   
   Inside your test class, define test methods that exercise different aspects of your code. Each test method should begin with the word "test" to indicate that it is a test case. Here's an example:

   ```swift
   func testAddition() {
       let result = 2 + 2
       XCTAssertEqual(result, 4, "Addition should return 4")
   }
   ```

   In this example, we perform the addition of 2 and 2, and then use `XCTAssertEqual` to check if the result is equal to 4. If the assertion fails, the test will be marked as a failure.

3. Run your tests:
   
   To run your tests, press Cmd+U or select Test from the Product menu. Xcode will execute all the test methods within your test class and display the results in the Test navigator.

   The green checkmark indicates that the test was successful, while the red cross indicates a failure. If a test fails, Xcode will also provide detailed information about the failure.

   It's good practice to run your tests frequently, ensuring that your code modifications don't introduce any regressions.

4. Continue writing more tests:
   
   Repeat steps 2 and 3 to add more test cases to your test class. Aim to cover different scenarios and edge cases to ensure full code coverage.

By adopting TDD and writing thorough unit tests, you can gain confidence in the correctness of your code and make it easier to identify and fix bugs. XCTest provides various assertion methods and powerful features to assist you in writing comprehensive tests.

Remember to test individual components of your code in isolation, mocking any external dependencies, for effective unit testing.
