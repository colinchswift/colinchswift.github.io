Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology used to extract text from images or scanned documents. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement OCR using the Combine framework in Swift.

## What is Combine?
Combine is an Apple-provided framework introduced in iOS 13 that enables reactive programming with Swift. It provides a declarative approach to processing asynchronous events and enables you to easily handle streams of values over time.

## Preparing the Project
To get started, create a new SwiftUI project in Xcode. Make sure to select "Use SwiftUI", as we will be using Combine with a SwiftUI-based user interface.

## Importing the Vision Framework
OCR requires the Vision framework, which provides high-level APIs for computer vision tasks, including text recognition. To import the Vision framework, add the following import statement at the top of your SwiftUI view:

```swift
import Vision
```

## Implementing OCR with Combine
Now, let's dive into implementing OCR with Combine. First, we will need to create an instance of the `VNRecognizeTextRequest` class from the Vision framework. This request is used to process the image and extract text:

```swift
func recognizeText(for image: UIImage) -> Future<String, Error> {
    return Future<String, Error> { promise in
        guard let cgImage = image.cgImage else {
            promise(.failure(OCRError.invalidImage))
            return
        }
        
        let request = VNRecognizeTextRequest { request, error in
            if let error = error {
                promise(.failure(error))
                return
            }
            
            guard let observations = request.results as? [VNRecognizedTextObservation] else {
                promise(.failure(OCRError.noResults))
                return
            }
            
            let recognizedText = observations.compactMap { observation in
                observation.topCandidates(1).first?.string
            }.joined(separator: " ")
            
            promise(.success(recognizedText))
        }
        
        let handler = VNImageRequestHandler(cgImage: cgImage, options: [:])
        
        do {
            try handler.perform([request])
        } catch {
            promise(.failure(error))
        }
    }
}
```

In the code above, we use the `VNRecognizeTextRequest` class to create a text recognition request. We pass in an image and handle the results asynchronously using Combine's `Future` type, which represents a value or an error that will be available in the future.

The `recognizedText` variable is created by iterating through the `VNRecognizedTextObservation` objects returned by the request and extracting the top candidate for each observation. Finally, we join the recognized text with spaces and return it in the `Future`.

## Using OCR in SwiftUI
Now that we have the OCR implementation, let's see how we can use it in our SwiftUI view. First, create an `@State` variable to hold the image selected by the user:

```swift
@State private var selectedImage: UIImage?
```

Next, add an `ImagePickerView` to your SwiftUI view. This view will present a picker sheet allowing the user to select an image:

```swift
.sheet(isPresented: $isShowingImagePicker, onDismiss: loadImage) {
    ImagePickerView(image: $selectedImage)
}
```

Make sure to add the necessary SwiftUI code to handle the presentation and dismissal of the image picker.

Finally, use Combine to perform OCR when the user taps a button:

```swift
Button(action: {
    guard let image = selectedImage else { return }
    
    recognizeText(for: image)
        .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
            // Handle completion
        }, receiveValue: { recognizedText in
            // Use recognized text
        })
        .store(in: &cancellables)
}) {
    Text("Extract Text")
}
```

In the code above, we use the `recognizeText` function we implemented earlier, chaining it with the `sink` operator to handle the recognized text or any error that occurs during the OCR process. The recognized text can then be used in any way you see fit.

## Conclusion
By leveraging Combine's reactive programming capabilities and the Vision framework in iOS, we can easily implement OCR functionality in our SwiftUI apps. This allows us to extract text from images or scanned documents, opening up a wide range of possibilities for data processing and analysis. Combine empowers us to handle asynchronous tasks elegantly, reducing code complexity and improving readability.

Implementing OCR with Combine is an exciting use case for this powerful framework, enabling us to build advanced applications with ease.
