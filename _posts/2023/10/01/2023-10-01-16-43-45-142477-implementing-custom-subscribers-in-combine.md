Combine is Apple's framework for handling asynchronous and event-based programming. It provides a simple and functional way to handle streams of values and perform operations on them. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement custom subscribers in Combine.

## Subscribers in Combine

A subscriber in Combine communicates with a publisher and receives values from it. The `Subscriber` protocol provided by Combine has several methods to interact with the publisher, such as `receive(subscription:)`, `receive(_: Input)`, and `receive(completion:)`. By implementing these methods, we can define our custom behavior for handling values received from a publisher.

## Implementing a Custom Subscriber

To implement a custom subscriber, we need to create a struct or a class that conforms to the `Subscriber` protocol. Let's take a look at an example of a simple custom subscriber:

```swift
import Combine

struct MySubscriber<Input, Failure: Error>: Subscriber {
    typealias Input = Input
    typealias Failure = Failure
    
    func receive(subscription: Subscription) {
        // Handle the subscription, e.g., save it for later use
    }
    
    func receive(_ input: Input) -> Subscribers.Demand {
        // Handle received values
        return .none
    }
    
    func receive(completion: Subscribers.Completion<Failure>) {
        // Handle completion, e.g., handle errors or finalize any processing
    }
}
```

In this example, `MySubscriber` is a generic struct that conforms to the `Subscriber` protocol. We have defined associated types `Input` and `Failure` to specify the type of values and errors that can be received.

Inside the `receive(subscription:)` method, we can handle the received subscription. This could involve storing it for later use or requesting demand from the publisher.

The `receive(_:)` method is called when a value is received from the publisher. Here, we can define our custom logic to process and handle the received values.

The `receive(completion:)` method is called when the publisher completes its operation. We can handle any errors or finalize any processing based on the completion status.

## Using a Custom Subscriber

Once we have implemented our custom subscriber, we can use it with a publisher to start receiving values. To do so, we create an instance of the subscriber and call the `subscribe(_:)` method on the publisher. Here's an example:

```swift
let publisher = Just("Hello, Combine!")

let subscriber = MySubscriber<String, Never>()
publisher.subscribe(subscriber)
```

In this example, we have created a simple publisher using the `Just` operator, which emits a single value and completes immediately. We then create an instance of our custom subscriber, `MySubscriber`, and subscribe it to the publisher using the `subscribe(_:)` method.

## Conclusion

Implementing custom subscribers in Combine allows us to define our own logic for handling values received from publishers. By conforming to the `Subscriber` protocol and implementing the appropriate methods, we have full control over how to process and react to the received values. Combining custom subscribers with other operators and publishers in Combine provides a powerful toolset for handling asynchronous and event-based programming in Swift.
