The Combine framework is an important addition to Apple's ecosystem, providing a declarative and reactive way of working with asynchronous events. At the core of Combine are two key concepts: publishers and subscribers. In this blog post, we will explore these concepts in detail to gain a better understanding of how they work together.

## Publishers

Publishers in Combine are responsible for emitting values and completion events to subscribers. They can emit zero or more values, indicating that a new event has occurred. There are different types of publishers available in Combine, such as `Just`, `Future`, `NotificationCenter.Publisher`, and more. Publishers are composable, meaning that you can combine them or transform them using various operators to create complex publishers that suit your needs.

### Example Code:

```swift
import Combine

let publisher = Just("Hello, World!")

publisher
    .sink { value in
        print(value)
    }
```

In this example, we create a `Just` publisher that emits a single value. We then subscribe to the publisher using the `sink` operator, which receives each value emitted by the publisher and prints it to the console. You can think of publishers as producers of events.

## Subscribers

Subscribers, on the other hand, are the consumers of events emitted by publishers. They receive values and completion events from the publishers to perform some action or process the data. Subscribers define how to handle these events by implementing specific methods. There are different types of subscribers available in Combine, such as `Sink`, `Assign`, `Future`, `URLSession.DataTaskPublisher`, and more.

### Example Code:

```swift
import Combine

let publisher = PassthroughSubject<String, Never>()

let subscriber = publisher
    .sink { value in
        print(value)
    }

publisher.send("Hello, World!")
```

In this example, we create a `PassthroughSubject` publisher, which allows us to manually send values to subscribers using the `send` method. We then create a subscriber using the `sink` operator, which prints each value received from the publisher. You can think of subscribers as consumers of events.

## Conclusion

Publishers and subscribers are the fundamental building blocks of Combine. Publishers emit values and completion events, while subscribers consume these events and perform some action. By understanding the roles of publishers and subscribers, you can effectively leverage the power of Combine to handle asynchronous events in a declarative and reactive manner.
