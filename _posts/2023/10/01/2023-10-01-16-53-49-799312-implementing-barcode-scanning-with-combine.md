Barcode scanning is a common feature in many mobile applications, allowing users to quickly scan barcodes using their device's camera. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement a barcode scanning feature using the Combine framework in iOS.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have the following:

- Xcode 11 or later
- Basic knowledge of SwiftUI and Combine

## Setting up the Project
1. Open Xcode and create a new SwiftUI project.
2. Import the required frameworks by adding the following statement to your `ContentView.swift` file:

```swift
import AVFoundation
import Combine
```

## Barcode Scanning Logic
We will use the `AVCaptureSession` and `AVCaptureMetadataOutput` classes from the AVFoundation framework to implement the barcode scanning logic. The Combine framework will be used to handle the asynchronous nature of capturing and processing the scanned data.

1. Create a `BarcodeScanner` class that conforms to the `ObservableObject` protocol:

```swift
final class BarcodeScanner: ObservableObject {
    private let session = AVCaptureSession()
    private let output = AVCaptureMetadataOutput()
    private var cancellables: Set<AnyCancellable> = []
  
    @Published var scannedCode: String = ""
  
    init() {
        configureCaptureSession()
    }
  
    private func configureCaptureSession() {
        guard let device = AVCaptureDevice.default(for: .video),
              let input = try? AVCaptureDeviceInput(device: device) else {
            return
        }
      
        session.addInput(input)
        session.addOutput(output)
      
        output.setMetadataObjectsDelegate(self, queue: DispatchQueue.main)
        output.metadataObjectTypes = [.ean8, .ean13, .pdf417]
    }
  
    func startScanning() {
        session.startRunning()
    }
  
    func stopScanning() {
        session.stopRunning()
    }
}
```

2. Implement the `AVCaptureMetadataOutputObjectsDelegate` protocol to handle the scanned data:

```swift
extension BarcodeScanner: AVCaptureMetadataOutputObjectsDelegate {
    func metadataOutput(_ output: AVCaptureMetadataOutput, didOutput metadataObjects: [AVMetadataObject], from connection: AVCaptureConnection) {
        guard let object = metadataObjects.first as? AVMetadataMachineReadableCodeObject,
              let code = object.stringValue else {
            return
        }
      
        stopScanning()
        scannedCode = code
    }
}
```

## SwiftUI Integration
Now that we have our barcode scanning logic, let's integrate it into our SwiftUI view.

1. In your `ContentView.swift` file, declare an instance of the `BarcodeScanner` class:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject private var scanner = BarcodeScanner()
  
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Scanned Code: \(scanner.scannedCode)")
          
            Button(action: {
                scanner.startScanning()
            }) {
                Text("Start Scanning")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

2. Run the application on an iOS device with a camera and test the barcode scanning functionality.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored how to implement barcode scanning using Combine in an iOS application. By using the AVFoundation framework for capturing and processing the scanned data, and Combine for handling the asynchronous operations, we were able to create a simple barcode scanning feature in our SwiftUI application. You can now expand on this logic to meet the needs of your own application.
