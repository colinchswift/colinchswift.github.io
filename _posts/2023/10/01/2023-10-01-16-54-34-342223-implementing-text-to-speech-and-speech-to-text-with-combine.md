In this blog post, we will explore how to implement text-to-speech and speech-to-text functionalities using the Combine framework in iOS apps. Combine is a powerful framework introduced by Apple that allows you to work with asynchronous events and streamline your reactive programming code.

## Text-to-Speech (TTS)

To implement text-to-speech functionality, we can leverage the `AVSpeechSynthesizer` class provided by UIKit. This class provides the ability to synthesize and speak text in iOS apps.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use Combine to convert a text string to speech:

```swift
import AVFoundation
import Combine

func speakText(_ text: String) -> AnyPublisher<Void, Error> {
    return Future<Void, Error> { promise in
        let synthesizer = AVSpeechSynthesizer()
        
        let utterance = AVSpeechUtterance(string: text)
        utterance.voice = AVSpeechSynthesisVoice(language: "en-US")
        
        synthesizer.speak(utterance)
        
        let speechCompletionObserver = NotificationCenter.default
            .publisher(for: .AVSpeechUtteranceDidFinish)
            .sink { _ in promise(.success(())) }
        
        return {
            synthesizer.stopSpeaking(at: .immediate)
            speechCompletionObserver.cancel()
        }
    }
    .eraseToAnyPublisher()
}
```

In this code, `speakText` is a function that takes a text string and returns a publisher that emits `Void` values when the speech is completed or an error if something goes wrong.

To use this function, simply call it passing the desired text:

```swift
speakText("Hello, world!")
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
        switch completion {
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Speech synthesis failed with error: \(error)")
        case .finished:
            print("Speech synthesis completed successfully.")
        }
    }, receiveValue: { _ in })
    .store(in: &cancellableSet)
```

By subscribing to the publisher returned by `speakText`, we can receive completion events indicating the status of the speech synthesis.

## Speech-to-Text (STT)

To implement speech-to-text functionality, we can use the `SFSpeechRecognizer` class provided by the Speech framework. This class can convert spoken language into written text.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use Combine to convert speech to text:

```swift
import Speech
import Combine

func transcribeSpeech() -> AnyPublisher<String, Error> {
    return Future<String, Error> { promise in
        let recognizer = SFSpeechRecognizer(locale: Locale(identifier: "en-US"))
        let audioEngine = AVAudioEngine()
        let recognitionRequest = SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest()
        
        guard let inputNode = audioEngine.inputNode else {
            promise(.failure(NSError(domain: "Audio input node unavailable.", code: 0, userInfo: nil)))
            return
        }
        
        recognitionRequest.shouldReportPartialResults = true
        
        let recognitionTask = recognizer?.recognitionTask(with: recognitionRequest) { result, error in
            if let result = result {
                promise(.success(result.bestTranscription.formattedString))
            } else if let error = error {
                promise(.failure(error))
            }
        }
        
        let audioSession = AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()
        try? audioSession.setCategory(.record, mode: .measurement, options: .duckOthers)
        
        audioEngine.prepare()
        
        do {
            try audioEngine.start()
        } catch {
            promise(.failure(error))
        }
        
        return {
            audioEngine.stop()
            audioEngine.inputNode?.removeTap(onBus: 0)
            
            recognitionRequest.endAudio()
            recognitionTask?.cancel()
        }
    }
    .eraseToAnyPublisher()
}
```

In this code, `transcribeSpeech` is a function that returns a publisher that emits the transcribed speech string when the speech-to-text conversion is completed, or an error if something goes wrong.

To use this function, simply call it and subscribe to the publisher:

```swift
transcribeSpeech()
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
        switch completion {
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Speech to text conversion failed with error: \(error)")
        case .finished:
            print("Speech to text conversion completed successfully.")
        }
    }, receiveValue: { result in
        print("Transcribed speech: \(result)")
    })
    .store(in: &cancellableSet)
```

By subscribing to the publisher returned by `transcribeSpeech`, we can receive the transcribed speech string or any error that occurred during the conversion.

### Conclusion
