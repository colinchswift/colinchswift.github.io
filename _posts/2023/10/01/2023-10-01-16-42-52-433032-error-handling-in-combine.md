Combine is a powerful framework introduced by Apple that simplifies asynchronous and event-driven programming in Swift. It provides declarative APIs to handle streams of values and events. When working with Combine, it is important to have a clear understanding of error handling, as it allows us to gracefully handle and recover from errors that may occur during the stream processing. In this blog post, we will explore different techniques for handling errors in Combine.

## 1. Catching and replacing errors

One common scenario in Combine is the need to catch and replace errors with a fallback value or a default value. This can be achieved using the `catch` operator. Here's an example:

```swift
import Combine

enum CustomError: Error {
    case someError
}

let publisher = Future<Int, Error> { promise in
    promise(.success(42))
}

publisher
    .tryMap { value -> Int in
        if value > 50 {
            throw CustomError.someError
        }
        return value
    }
    .catch { error -> AnyPublisher<Int, Error> in
        print("Caught error: \(error)")
        return Just(0)
            .setFailureType(to: Error.self)
            .eraseToAnyPublisher()
    }
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
        if case .failure(let error) = completion {
            print("Received completion with error: \(error)")
        }
    }, receiveValue: { value in
        print("Received value: \(value)")
    })
```

In this example, we have a `Future` publisher that emits a single value. The `tryMap` operator is used to check if the value is greater than 50, and if so, throws a custom error. The `catch` operator catches the error and replaces it with a default value of 0. The `sink` operator is used to receive the final value or the error.

## 2. Retrying after error

Another common use case is retrying an operation after an error occurs. Combine provides the `retry` operator to retry a publisher a certain number of times or until it succeeds. Here's an example:

```swift
import Combine

enum CustomError: Error {
    case someError
}

let publisher = Future<Int, Error> { promise in
    print("Performing operation...")
    
    DispatchQueue.global().asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1) {
        if Bool.random() {
            promise(.success(42))
        } else {
            promise(.failure(CustomError.someError))
        }
    }
}

publisher
    .retry(3)
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
        if case .failure(let error) = completion {
            print("Received completion with error: \(error)")
        }
    }, receiveValue: { value in
        print("Received value: \(value)")
    })
```

In this example, the `Future` publisher simulates an operation that may fail randomly. The `retry` operator is used to retry the operation a maximum of 3 times. After each failure, the publisher will be retried after a certain delay. The `sink` operator is used to handle the final result.

## Conclusion

Error handling is an essential part of any application's logic, and Combine provides various operators to handle errors in a streamlined manner. By using techniques such as catching and replacing errors, or retrying operations, we can build robust and fault-tolerant reactive systems with Combine. By understanding these error handling techniques, you'll be able to write more reliable and resilient Combine code.
