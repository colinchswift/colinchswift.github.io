NFC (Near Field Communication) is a wireless technology that allows two devices to communicate over short distances. It has various applications in smart city environments, such as for contactless payments, access control, and public transportation systems. In this blog post, we will explore how to integrate NFC functionality into a Swift application for smart city use cases.

## What is NFC?
NFC is a short-range wireless technology that enables data transfer between devices by bringing them close together (usually within a few centimeters). It operates at a frequency of 13.56 MHz and allows for two-way communication. NFC can be used for various purposes, including contactless payments, data sharing, and access control systems.

## NFC in Smart City Applications
In the context of smart city applications, NFC has several benefits. It provides a secure and convenient method for processing contactless payments, making it ideal for use in transportation systems, parking meters, and ticketing systems. NFC can also be used for access control, allowing users to tap their NFC-enabled devices to gain entry to buildings or restricted areas.

## Setting Up NFC in Swift
To enable NFC functionality in your Swift application, you need to follow these steps:

1. Enable the Near Field Communication capability in your Xcode project.
2. Import the Core NFC framework in your view controller.
3. Conform to the NFCNDEFReaderSessionDelegate protocol to handle NFC tag reading events.

## Reading NFC Tags
Once you have set up NFC in your Swift project, you can start reading NFC tags. NFC tags are small passive devices that contain data that can be read by an NFC-enabled device. Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to read an NFC tag using Swift:

```swift
import CoreNFC

class NFCReaderViewController: UIViewController, NFCNDEFReaderSessionDelegate {
    func startNFCSession() {
        let session = NFCNDEFReaderSession(delegate: self, queue: nil, invalidateAfterFirstRead: false)
        session.begin()
    }
    
    func readerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession, didDetectNDEFs messages: [NFCNDEFMessage]) {
        // Handle detected NFC tag data here
        for message in messages {
            for record in message.records {
                let payload = String(data: record.payload, encoding: .utf8)
                print("NFC Tag Payload: \(payload ?? "")")
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Handle error cases
    
    func readerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession, didInvalidateWithError error: Error) {
        // Handle session invalidation error
    }
}
```

## Writing to NFC Tags
In addition to reading NFC tags, you can also write data to NFC tags using Swift. This allows you to create customized NFC tags for various smart city applications. Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to write an NDEF message to an NFC tag:

```swift
import CoreNFC

class NFCWriterViewController: UIViewController, NFCNDEFReaderSessionDelegate {
    func startNFCSession() {
        let session = NFCNDEFReaderSession(delegate: self, queue: nil, invalidateAfterFirstRead: false)
        session.begin()
    }
    
    func readerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession, didDetect tags: [NFCTag]) {
        if tags.count > 0 {
            let firstTag = tags.first!
            session.connect(to: firstTag) { (error: Error?) in
                if error != nil {
                    // Handle tag connection error
                } else {
                    let message = NFCNDEFMessage(records: [
                        NFCNDEFPayload(format: .nfcWellKnown, type: "T".data(using: .utf8)!, identifier: Data(), payload: "Hello World".data(using: .utf8)!)
                    ])
                    firstTag.writeNDEF(message) { (error: Error?) in
                        if error != nil {
                            // Handle tag write error
                        } else {
                            // Successfully wrote NDEF message to NFC tag
                        }
                        session.invalidate()
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Handle error cases
    
    func readerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession, didInvalidateWithError error: Error) {
        // Handle session invalidation error
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
NFC integration is a crucial aspect of smart city applications, as it enables secure and convenient communication between devices. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily incorporate NFC functionality into your Swift application for various smart city use cases.
