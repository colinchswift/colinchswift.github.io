In this blog post, we will explore how to implement NFC (Near Field Communication) technology for access control in buildings using Swift programming language. NFC is a short-range wireless communication technology that allows devices to exchange data when they are in close proximity.

## What is NFC-enabled Access Control?

NFC-enabled access control system allows users to use their smartphones or NFC-compatible cards to gain access to secured areas in a building. Instead of using traditional access control methods like physical keys or access cards, NFC technology provides a more convenient and secure way to grant access.

## Getting Started

To start implementing NFC-enabled access control in Swift, we need to make sure our iOS device supports NFC. NFC is available on iPhones starting from iPhone 7 and onwards.

First, we need to enable the NFC capability for our app. Open your Xcode project, go to the project settings, select your target, and navigate to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab. Click on the "+" button and add the "Near Field Communication Tag Reading" capability to your app.

## Implementing NFC Reader

We will use the Core NFC framework provided by Apple to read NFC tags. The Core NFC framework allows our app to interact with NFC tags and read their data. To implement the NFC reader functionality, follow these steps:

1. Import the Core NFC framework into your ViewController: 

```swift
import CoreNFC
```

2. Conform to the `NFCNDEFReaderSessionDelegate` protocol:

```swift
class MyViewController: UIViewController, NFCNDEFReaderSessionDelegate {
    //...
}
```

3. Implement the delegate methods for handling NFC tag detection:

```swift
func readerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession, didDetectNDEFs messages: [NFCNDEFMessage]) {
    // Handle detected NFC tags
}

func readerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession, didInvalidateWithError error: Error) {
    // Handle session errors
}

func readerSessionDidBecomeActive(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession) {
    // Session started
}

func readerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession, didDetect tags: [NFCNDEFTag]) {
    // Handle detected tags
}
```

4. Create an instance of `NFCNDEFReaderSession` and start the session:

```swift
let session = NFCNDEFReaderSession(delegate: self, queue: DispatchQueue.main, invalidateAfterFirstRead: false)
session.begin()
```

With these steps, your app is now ready to read NFC tags.

## Handling NFC Tags

When an NFC tag is detected by the reader, the `didDetectNDEFs` delegate method is called. Inside this method, we can fetch the data from the NFC tag and perform any necessary actions.

Here is an example of how we can extract the payload data from an NFC tag:

```swift
func readerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession, didDetectNDEFs messages: [NFCNDEFMessage]) {
    for message in messages {
        for record in message.records {
            if let payload = String(data: record.payload, encoding: .utf8) {
                print("Payload: \(payload)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we are printing the payload of each NDEF record in the detected NFC tag.

## Integrating with Building Access System

Once we have read the NFC tag, we can integrate our app with the building access system to grant access to the user. The integration process will vary depending on the access control system used in your building.

Typically, the building access system will have an API or backend service that accepts access requests. You can make HTTP requests from your app to this API, passing the necessary authentication data, such as user credentials or a generated access token.

## Conclusion

Implementing NFC-enabled access control for buildings using Swift provides a modern and convenient way to manage access to secured areas. By leveraging the power of NFC technology and integrating with the building access system, we can enhance the security and user experience for building access control.

Make sure to follow the guidelines provided by your building access system provider and the Core NFC framework documentation to ensure a secure and reliable implementation.
