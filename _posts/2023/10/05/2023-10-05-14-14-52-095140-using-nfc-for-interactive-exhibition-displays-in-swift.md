With the rise of interactive experiences, NFC (Near Field Communication) technology has become increasingly popular for creating engaging exhibition displays. In this blog post, we will explore how you can use NFC in your Swift app to create interactive displays for exhibitions or trade shows.

## 1. Understanding NFC

NFC is a short-range wireless communication technology that allows devices to exchange information or establish a connection by simply bringing them close together. It is commonly used for contactless payments, access control, and data transfer.

In the context of exhibition displays, NFC can be used to provide additional information about an exhibit or trigger specific actions when a smartphone or NFC-enabled device is brought close to an NFC tag or reader.

## 2. Setting Up NFC in Xcode

To get started with NFC in your Swift app, you'll need to enable the "Near Field Communication Tag Reading" capability in Xcode. 

1. Open your project in Xcode.
2. Go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab of your target.
3. Click the "+" button to add a new capability.
4. Search for "Near Field Communication Tag Reading" and enable it.

## 3. Reading NFC Tags

Reading NFC tags is a straightforward process in Swift. Here's a basic example of how to read the contents of an NFC tag:

```swift
import CoreNFC

class NFCReaderViewController: UIViewController, NFCNDEFReaderSessionDelegate {
  
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }

    func beginNFCReadingSession() {
        let readerSession = NFCNDEFReaderSession(delegate: self, queue: nil, invalidateAfterFirstRead: false)
        readerSession.begin()
    }

    func readerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession, didDetectNDEFs messages: [NFCNDEFMessage]) {
        for message in messages {
            for record in message.records {
                // Extract and process the data from the NFC tag record
                let payload = String(data: record.payload, encoding: .utf8)
                print("Data: \(payload ?? "")")
            }
        }
    }

    func readerSessionDidBecomeActive(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession) {

    }

    func readerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession, didInvalidateWithError error: Error) {
        print("Error: \(error)")
    }
}
```

This code sets up an NFC reader session, and when an NFC tag is detected, it retrieves the data from the tag's record and processes it accordingly.

## 4. Writing NFC Tags

In addition to reading NFC tags, you can also write data to them using NFC in your Swift app. Here's an example implementation:

```swift
import CoreNFC

class NFCWriterViewController: UIViewController, NFCNDEFWriterSessionDelegate {
  
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }

    func beginNFCWritingSession() {
        let writerSession = NFCNDEFWriterSession(delegate: self, queue: nil)
        writerSession.begin()
    }

    func writerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFWriterSession, didDetect tags: [NFCNDEFTag]) {
        for tag in tags {
            session.connect(to: tag) { (error: Error?) in
                if let error = error {
                    print("Error connecting to tag: \(error)")
                    return
                }

                let payload = "Hello, NFC!".data(using: .utf8)
                let textRecord = NFCNDEFPayload.wellKnownTypeTextPayload(string: "Hello, World!", locale: Locale(identifier: "en"))

                let message = NFCNDEFMessage(records: [textRecord])

                session.writeNDEF(message) { (error: Error?) in
                    if let error = error {
                        print("Error writing to tag: \(error)")
                        return
                    }

                    print("Successfully wrote to NFC tag")
                }
            }
        }
    }

    func writerSessionDidBecomeActive(_ session: NFCNDEFWriterSession) {

    }

    func writerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFWriterSession, didInvalidateWithError error: Error) {
        print("Error: \(error)")
    }
}
```

This code sets up an NFC writer session and writes a custom text record to the detected NFC tag.

## 5. Conclusion
