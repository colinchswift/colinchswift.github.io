Contactless ticketing systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, enabling users to simply tap their NFC-enabled devices to gain access to transportation, events, and more. In this blog post, we will explore how to use NFC technology in a Swift application to implement a contactless ticketing system.

## What is NFC?
Near Field Communication (NFC) is a wireless communication technology that allows devices to establish a connection by touching them together or bringing them into close proximity. NFC is commonly used in contactless payment systems, access control systems, and now, ticketing systems.

## NFC in Swift
In order to use NFC in a Swift application, we need to take advantage of the Core NFC framework. This framework provides a set of classes and protocols to help us interact with NFC-enabled devices.

To start using NFC in our project, we need to add the Core NFC framework to our Xcode project. To do this, follow these steps:
1. Open your Xcode project.
2. Select your project file in the project navigator.
3. Go to the "General" tab.
4. Scroll down to the "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" section.
5. Click on the "+" button.
6. Select "Add Other...".
7. Navigate to "Developer/Library/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes" and select "iOS.simruntime". This will add the Core NFC framework to your project.

## Implementing Contactless Ticketing System
Now that we have added the Core NFC framework to our project, we can start implementing the contactless ticketing system. The basic flow of a contactless ticketing system involves the following steps:

1. iPhone scans and detects an NFC tag.
2. The application reads the data from the NFC tag.
3. The application validates the ticket and performs the necessary actions.

Let's take a closer look at how we can achieve this in Swift:

```swift
import CoreNFC

class NFCReaderViewController: UIViewController, NFCNDEFReaderSessionDelegate {
    var nfcSession: NFCNDEFReaderSession?
    
    @IBAction func startScanning(_ sender: UIButton) {
        nfcSession = NFCNDEFReaderSession(delegate: self, queue: DispatchQueue.main, invalidateAfterFirstRead: true)
        nfcSession?.begin()
    }
    
    func readerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession, didDetectNDEFs messages: [NFCNDEFMessage]) {
        guard let nfcTag = messages.first?.records.first else {
            return
        }
        
        // Process the ticket data here
        let ticketData = String(data: nfcTag.payload, encoding: .utf8)
        processTicketData(ticketData)
    }
    
    func processTicketData(_ ticketData: String?) {
        // Validate the ticket and perform necessary actions
        if let ticketData = ticketData {
            print("Ticket data: \(ticketData)")
            // Perform actions based on the ticket data
        }
    }
}
```

In the code above, we have a simple `NFCReaderViewController` with a button. When the button is tapped, it starts an NFC session and listens for NFC tags. When a tag is detected, the `didDetectNDEFs` delegate method is called, where we retrieve the ticket data and process it.

Please note that this is just a basic implementation. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle different types of NFC tags, encryption, and security measures to ensure the integrity and validity of the tickets.

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we learned how to use NFC technology in a Swift application to implement a contactless ticketing system. We explored the basics of NFC in Swift using the Core NFC framework and implemented a simple ticket reading functionality. By expanding on this foundation, you can create a robust and secure contactless ticketing system for your application.
