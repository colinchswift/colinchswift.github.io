## Introduction

Near Field Communication (NFC) is a technology that allows devices to communicate with each other by bringing them close together. In the context of smart health monitoring, NFC can be used to securely transfer health data between a device and an NFC-enabled sensor, such as a fitness tracker or glucose monitor.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to implement NFC in a Swift-based iOS app for smart health monitoring.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need:

- Xcode installed on your Mac
- An iPhone with iOS 13 or later (to test the NFC functionality)

## Getting Started

1. Create a new project in Xcode by selecting "File" > "New" > "Project" and choose the "Single View App" template.

2. Add the Core NFC framework to your project by selecting the project in the Project Navigator, then select the target, go to "General" > "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" and click the "+" button to add CoreNFC.framework.

3. Open the ViewController.swift file and import the CoreNFC framework:

```swift
import CoreNFC
```

4. Make your ViewController conform to the NFCNDEFReaderSessionDelegate protocol:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, NFCNDEFReaderSessionDelegate {
    // ...
}
```

## Reading NFC Data

1. Create an instance of NFCNDEFReaderSession and start a session:

```swift
let session = NFCNDEFReaderSession(delegate: self, queue: nil, invalidateAfterFirstRead: false)
session.begin()
```

2. Implement the delegate method to handle the NFC tag detection:

```swift
func readerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession, didDetectNDEFs messages: [NFCNDEFMessage]) {
    // Handle the detected NFC tag data
}
```

3. Iterate over the detected messages and retrieve the records:

```swift
for message in messages {
    for record in message.records {
        let payload = String(data: record.payload, encoding: .utf8)
        print("Payload: \(payload ?? "")")
    }
}
```

## Writing NFC Data

1. Create an instance of NFCNDEFMessage to hold the record:

```swift
let payloadData = "Hello, NFC!".data(using: .utf8)!
let payloadRecord = NFCNDEFPayload.init(format: .nfcWellKnown, type: "T".data(using: .utf8)!, identifier: Data(), payload: payloadData)
let message = NFCNDEFMessage(records: [payloadRecord])
```

2. Create an instance of NFCNDEFWriterSession and start a session:

```swift
let session = NFCNDEFWriterSession(delegate: self, queue: nil)
session.begin()
```

3. Implement the delegate method to handle the writing process:

```swift
func writerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFWriterSession, didWriteNDEFs messages: [NFCNDEFMessage]) {
    // Handle successful writing
}

func writerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFWriterSession, didInvalidateWithError error: Error) {
    // Handle session invalidation and error
}
```

4. Write the message to an NFC tag:

```swift
session.connect(to: tag) { (error: Error?) in
    if error != nil {
        session.invalidate(errorMessage: "Failed to connect to tag.")
    } else {
        session.writeMessage(message)
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to implement NFC functionality in a Swift-based iOS app for smart health monitoring. We have explored both reading and writing NFC data using the CoreNFC framework. With this knowledge, you can now integrate NFC capabilities into your own health monitoring apps and securely transfer data between devices and NFC-enabled sensors.
