## What is NFC? {#what-is-nfc}

Near Field Communication (NFC) is a short-range wireless technology that enables communication between devices in close proximity, typically a few centimeters apart. It allows for the exchange of small amounts of data securely and quickly.

NFC is widely used for contactless payments, where users can make payments by simply tapping their mobile devices or credit cards on a compatible terminal. This technology provides a convenient and secure way for making transactions without the need for physical cards or cash.

## Setting up the Project {#setting-up-the-project}

To get started with NFC in Swift, create a new iOS project in Xcode:

1. Launch Xcode and select "Create a new Xcode project."
2. Choose the "Single View App" template for your project.
3. Enter the necessary details and select a location to save your project.

## Enabling NFC Capability {#enabling-nfc-capability}

Before we can start using NFC in our project, we need to enable the NFC capability:

1. In the project navigator, select your project name.
2. Select the target for your app.
3. Go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab.
4. Click on the "+ Capability" button.
5. Search for "Near Field Communication Tag Reading" and enable it.

## Reading NFC Tags {#reading-nfc-tags}

To read NFC tags in Swift, follow these steps:

1. Import the `CoreNFC` framework in your Swift file:

```swift
import CoreNFC
```

2. Conform to the `NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate` protocol:

```swift
class MyViewController: UIViewController, NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate {
    // ...
}
```

3. Create an `NFCTagReaderSession` instance and start the session:

```swift
let nfcSession = NFCTagReaderSession(pollingOption: .iso14443, delegate: self)
nfcSession?.begin()
```

4. Implement the delegate method `tagReaderSession(_:didDetect tags:)` to handle tag detection:

```swift
func tagReaderSession(_ session: NFCTagReaderSession, didDetect tags: [NFCTag]) {
    // Process detected tags
}
```

5. Process the detected tags by implementing the necessary logic.

## Writing to NFC Tags {#writing-to-nfc-tags}

To write data to NFC tags in Swift, follow these steps:

1. Import the `CoreNFC` framework and conform to the `NFCNDEFReaderSessionDelegate` protocol.

2. Create an `NFCNDEFReaderSession` instance and start the session.

3. Implement the delegate method `readerSession(_:didDetectNDEFs:)` to handle NDEF detection.

4. Implement the necessary logic to write data to the NFC tags.

## Making Contactless Payments {#making-contactless-payments}

To enable contactless payments using NFC in Swift, we can leverage Apple Pay:

1. Enable Apple Pay for your app by following the necessary steps provided by Apple.

2. Implement the necessary payment processing logic using Apple Pay APIs.

3. Present the Apple Pay interface to the user when they choose to make a payment.

4. Handle the payment completion and any necessary callbacks.

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

In this blog post, we explored how to use NFC for contactless payments in Swift. NFC technology provides a convenient and secure way for users to make payments with their mobile devices or credit cards. By implementing NFC capabilities in your Swift application, you can enhance the payment experience for your users and provide them with a seamless payment process.

Be sure to check Apple's official documentation for more details and best practices when working with NFC and contactless payments in your Swift app.
