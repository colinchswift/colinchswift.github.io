## Introduction to NFC
NFC is a short-range wireless technology that enables communication between devices by bringing them close together. It is commonly used for contactless payment, ticketing, and data exchange. NFC tags can be embedded in physical objects, such as business cards, and can store data that can be read by other NFC-enabled devices.

## Setting up the project
To get started, create a new project in Xcode with Swift as the programming language. Make sure your device or simulator supports NFC by checking the "Capabilities" tab and enabling "Near Field Communication Tag Reading". 

## Checking NFC availability
Before performing any NFC operations, it is important to check if NFC is available on the device. This can be done using the `NFCTagReaderSession` class. Here's an example of how to check if NFC is available:

```swift
import CoreNFC
...
if NFCTagReaderSession.readingAvailable {
    // NFC is available, continue
} else {
    // NFC is not available on this device
}
```

## Creating an NFC session
To start communicating with NFC tags, we need to create an NFC session. This can be done by creating an instance of `NFCTagReaderSession` and implementing the delegate methods. Here's an example of how to create an NFC session:

```swift
import CoreNFC
...
let session = NFCTagReaderSession(pollingOption: .iso14443, delegate: self)
session.begin()
```

## Handling NFC tags
Once the NFC session is started, the `tagReaderSession(_:didDetect:)` delegate method will be called whenever a compatible NFC tag is detected. In this method, you can handle different types of NFC tags, such as NFCNDEFTag or NFCISO15693Tag. Here's an example of how to handle an NFC tag detection:

```swift
import CoreNFC
...
func tagReaderSession(_ session: NFCTagReaderSession, didDetect tags: [NFCTag]) {
    if case let .iso15693(tag) = tags.first! {
        // Handle ISO15693 tag
    }
    // Handle other tag types
}
```

## Writing and reading data
To write data to an NFC tag, you can use the `write(_:completionHandler:)` method of the relevant NFC tag object. Similarly, to read data from an NFC tag, you can use the `read(_:didFinishReading:error:)` method. Here's an example of how to write and read data from an ISO15693 tag:

```swift
import CoreNFC
...
tag.write([NFCISO15693CustomCommand(address: 0x04, data: Data([0x41, 0x42, 0x43]))]) { error in
    if let error = error {
        // Handle write error
    } else {
        // Write successful
    }
}
tag.readMultipleBlockSecurityStatus(range: NSRange(location: 0x00, length: 0x05)) { status, error in
    if let error = error {
        // Handle read error
    } else {
        // Process read data
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
Implementing NFC for digital business card exchange in Swift can greatly simplify the process of sharing contact information. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can create a seamless and efficient solution for exchanging digital business cards using NFC. Happy coding!
