In today's fast-paced world, supply chain traceability is crucial for ensuring the authenticity and quality of products. Near Field Communication (NFC) technology offers a convenient and secure way to track and verify products throughout the supply chain. In this article, we will explore how to integrate NFC into a Swift application to enhance supply chain traceability.

## What is NFC?

Near Field Communication (NFC) is a wireless technology that allows communication between devices in close proximity. It operates on radio frequency identification (RFID) principles and is commonly found in smartphones, cards, and other electronic devices.

## Why NFC for Supply Chain Traceability?

Supply chain traceability involves tracking and documenting the movement of products from their source to the end consumer. NFC provides a reliable and secure method for implementing traceability in the supply chain due to its unique capabilities:

- **Readability**: NFC tags can be easily read using a compatible device, providing real-time access to product information.
- **Data Security**: NFC utilizes encryption and secure communication protocols, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data.
- **User-Friendly**: NFC technology requires minimal user intervention, enabling quick and seamless product verification.

Integrating NFC in Swift
To integrate NFC functionality into your Swift application, follow the steps below:

1. **Enable NFC capabilities**: In Xcode, navigate to your project settings, select your app target, and under the "Signing & Capabilities" tab, enable the "Near Field Communication Tag Reading" capability.

2. **Import Core NFC framework**: add the following import statement at the top of your Swift file to gain access to the NFC framework: 

```swift
import CoreNFC
```

Reading NFC Tags
To read NFC tags, you need to implement the `NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate` protocol. Below is an example of how to implement the delegate methods:

```swift
class NFCReaderViewController: UIViewController, NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate {
    var nfcReaderSession: NFCTagReaderSession?

    func startNFCReaderSession() {
        nfcReaderSession = NFCTagReaderSession(pollingOption: .iso14443, delegate: self)
        nfcReaderSession?.begin()
    }

    // Delegate method called when a tag is detected
    func tagReaderSession(_ session: NFCTagReaderSession, didDetect tags: [NFCTag]) {
        if case let .miFare(tag) = tags.first! {
            session.connect(to: tag) { (error: Error?) in
                if error != nil {
                    print("Error connecting to tag: \(error!.localizedDescription)")
                    return
                }
                // Read data from the tag
                self.readData(from: tag)
                session.invalidate()
            }
        }
    }

    // Method to read data from the NFC tag
    func readData(from tag: NFCMiFareTag) {
        tag.readNDEF { (ndefMessage: NFCNDEFMessage?, error: Error?) in
            if error != nil {
                print("Error reading tag: \(error!.localizedDescription)")
                return
            }
            // Process the data in the NDEF message
            if let message = ndefMessage {
                for record in message.records {
                    guard let payload = String(data: record.payload, encoding: .utf8) else { continue }
                    print("Payload: \(payload)")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Writing to NFC Tags
To write data to NFC tags, you can use the `NFCNDEFPayload` class to create and write NDEF messages. Below is an example of how to write data to an NFC tag:

```swift
class NFCWriterViewController: UIViewController, NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate {
    var nfcReaderSession: NFCTagReaderSession?

    func startNFCWriterSession() {
        nfcReaderSession = NFCTagReaderSession(pollingOption: .iso14443, delegate: self)
        nfcReaderSession?.begin()
    }

    // Delegate method called when a tag is detected
    func tagReaderSession(_ session: NFCTagReaderSession, didDetect tags: [NFCTag]) {
        if case let .miFare(tag) = tags.first! {
            session.connect(to: tag) { (error: Error?) in
                if error != nil {
                    print("Error connecting to tag: \(error!.localizedDescription)")
                    return
                }
                // Write data to the tag
                self.writeData(to: tag)
                session.invalidate()
            }
        }
    }

    // Method to write data to the NFC tag
    func writeData(to tag: NFCMiFareTag) {
        let payload = NFCNDEFPayload(format: .wellKnown, type: Data("text/plain".utf8), identifier: Data(), payload: Data("Hello, NFC!".utf8))
        let message = NFCNDEFMessage(records: [payload])
        tag.writeNDEF(message) { (error: Error?) in
            if error != nil {
                print("Error writing tag: \(error!.localizedDescription)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
