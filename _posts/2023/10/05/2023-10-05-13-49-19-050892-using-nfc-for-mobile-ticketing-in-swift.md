In this blog post, we will explore how to use Near Field Communication (NFC) for mobile ticketing in Swift. NFC allows devices to communicate by simply bringing them close together, enabling seamless and secure transfer of data.

## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

Mobile ticketing systems are becoming increasingly popular for events, transportation, and more. NFC technology offers an efficient way to deliver and authenticate tickets using compatible smartphones or wearable devices. With NFC, users can simply tap their device to a reader to access their tickets, eliminating the need for physical tickets or QR codes.

## Setting Up NFC Capability<a name="setting-up-nfc-capability"></a>

To get started with NFC in your Swift project, follow these steps:

1. Open your Xcode project and navigate to the project settings.
2. Select your target and go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab.
3. Click on the "+" button to add a new capability.

4. Search for "Near Field Communication Tag Reading" and enable it.

5. Build and run your project to ensure the capability is correctly added.

## Reading NFC Tags<a name="reading-nfc-tags"></a>

To read NFC tags in your Swift app, you need to implement the `NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate` protocol. Here's an example of how to set up NFC tag reading:

```swift
import CoreNFC

class NFCReaderViewController: UIViewController, NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate {
    var nfcSession: NFCTagReaderSession?
    
    func startReading() {
        nfcSession = NFCTagReaderSession(pollingOption: .iso14443, delegate: self)
        nfcSession?.begin()
    }
    
    func tagReaderSession(_ session: NFCTagReaderSession, didDetect tags: [NFCTag]) {
        let tag = tags.first!
        
        session.connect(to: tag) { (error: Error?) in
            if error != nil {
                session.invalidate(errorMessage: "Connection failed.")
                return
            }
            
            if case let .miFare(smartCard) = tag {
                // Process MiFare data here
            }
            
            session.invalidate()
        }
    }
    
    // Rest of the NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate methods
}
```

In the above code, we create an instance of `NFCTagReaderSession` to start NFC tag reading. When a tag is detected, we establish a connection and can process specific tag types, such as MiFare in the example. 

## Writing NFC Tags<a name="writing-nfc-tags"></a>

To write information to NFC tags, you can use the `NFCNDEFWriterSession` class. Here's a code snippet to get you started:

```swift
import CoreNFC

class NFCWriterViewController: UIViewController, NFCNDEFWriterSessionDelegate {
    var nfcSession: NFCNDEFWriterSession?
    
    func startWriting(message: NFCNDEFMessage) {
        nfcSession = NFCNDEFWriterSession(delegate: self, queue: nil, invalidateAfterFirstWrite: true)
        nfcSession?.connect(to: .init())
        nfcSession?.writeNDEF(message)
    }
    
    func writerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFWriterSession, didWriteNDEF message: NFCNDEFMessage) {
        // Handle successful write operation here
    }
    
    // Rest of the NFCNDEFWriterSessionDelegate methods
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of `NFCNDEFWriterSession` to start writing operations. The `writeNDEF` method is used to write the `NFCNDEFMessage` to the connected NFC tag.

## Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>

In this blog post, we explored how to use NFC for mobile ticketing in Swift. We covered setting up NFC capability in Xcode, reading NFC tags using `NFCTagReaderSession`, and writing NFC tags using `NFCNDEFWriterSession`. NFC technology provides a convenient and secure way to enable mobile ticketing applications. Start experimenting with NFC in your Swift projects and create seamless ticketing experiences for your users.
