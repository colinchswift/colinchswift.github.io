Near Field Communication (NFC) is a short-range wireless communication technology that enables devices to communicate over a distance of a few centimeters. This technology is commonly used for contactless payments, access control, and data transfer between devices. If you are planning to integrate NFC functionality into your Swift application, there are a few requirements you need to consider. In this article, we will explore the necessary requirements for NFC integration in Swift.

## 1. Device compatibility

Not all iOS devices support NFC functionality. To ensure your application can utilize NFC, you need to consider the device compatibility. NFC is supported on the following iOS devices:

- iPhone XS, XS Max, XR, 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, SE (2nd generation), and later models
- Apple Watch Series 3 and later models with watchOS 7 or later

It's important to note that older iPhone models, iPad, and iPod touch do not have NFC capabilities.

## 2. NFC capability check

Before using any NFC functionality in your app, you should check if the user's device supports NFC. This can be done using the `CoreNFC` framework introduced in iOS 11. To check for NFC capability, you can use the `NFCTagReaderSession` class and its `readingAvailable` property. Here's an example of how the check can be performed:

```swift
import CoreNFC

if NFCTagReaderSession.readingAvailable {
    // NFC is available on this device
    // Continue with NFC integration
} else {
    // NFC is not available on this device
    // Provide alternative functionality or show an error message
}
```

## 3. Enable NFC capabilities

To use NFC in your Swift application, you need to enable the NFC capability in your Xcode project. Follow these steps to enable NFC capabilities:

1. Open your Xcode project.
2. Go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab.
3. Click the "+" button to add a new capability.
4. Search for "NFC Tag Reading" and select it.
5. Build and run your project.

Enabling the NFC capability allows your app to read NFC tags and interact with NFC-enabled devices.

## 4. NFC background reading

By default, NFC functionality in iOS only works when your app is in the foreground. If you want to enable NFC background reading, you need to add the `NFCReaderUsageDescription` key to your `Info.plist` file. This key describes why your app needs NFC access and will be shown to the user when requesting permission to use NFC in the background. Here's an example of how to add the `NFCReaderUsageDescription` key:

```xml
<key>NFCReaderUsageDescription</key>
<string>Your app needs NFC access for reading NFC tags in the background.</string>
```

Make sure to provide a clear and concise description of why your app requires NFC access in the background to comply with App Store guidelines.

## Conclusion

Integrating NFC functionality into your Swift application opens up new possibilities for contactless payments, data transfer, and other use cases. By ensuring device compatibility, performing NFC capability checks, enabling NFC capabilities, and enabling NFC background reading, you can provide a seamless NFC experience for your users.
