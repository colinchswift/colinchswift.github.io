In today's digital world, secure identity verification is of utmost importance. Near Field Communication (NFC) technology provides a convenient and secure way to transfer information between devices by simply bringing them close together. In this tutorial, we will explore how to use NFC in a Swift app for secure identity verification.

## What is NFC?
NFC is a short-range wireless technology that allows devices to communicate and transfer data when in close proximity. It is commonly used for contactless payments, access control, and identity verification. With NFC, you can securely exchange information between devices without the need for internet connectivity.

## Getting Started
To get started, create a new Swift project in Xcode. Make sure you have an iPhone with NFC capabilities for testing purposes. NFC is available on iPhone 7 and newer models.

## Setting Up NFC
First, you need to enable NFC capabilities in your project. Open your project's target settings, select the "Signing & Capabilities" tab, and click the "+" button to add a new capability. Search for "Near Field Communication Tag Reading" and enable it.

## Reading NFC Data
To read NFC data, you need to implement the `NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate` protocol. Create a new class that conforms to this protocol and implement the required methods.

```swift
import NearFieldCommunication

class NFCReaderViewController: UIViewController, NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate {
    var nfcSession: NFCTagReaderSession?
    
    func beginScanning() {
        if NFCTagReaderSession.readingAvailable {
            nfcSession = NFCTagReaderSession(pollingOption: .iso15693, delegate: self)
            nfcSession?.begin()
        }
    }
    
    func tagReaderSessionDidDetectTags(_ session: NFCTagReaderSession, tags: [NFCTag]) {
        if let firstTag = tags.first {
            session.connect(to: firstTag) { (error) in
                if error == nil {
                    // Read NFC data
                    // Process the data for identity verification
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Other required methods of the NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate protocol
}

```
In the `beginScanning()` method, we check if NFC reading is available and create a new `NFCTagReaderSession` with the appropriate polling option. When a tag is detected, the `tagReaderSessionDidDetectTags` method is called. Inside this method, we connect to the first tag and read the NFC data for identity verification.

## Writing NFC Data
To write NFC data, you need to use the `NFCNDEFPayload` class. This class represents an NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF) payload that can be written to an NFC tag.

```swift
import CoreNFC

func writeNFCData() {
    if NFCNDEFReaderSession.readingAvailable {
        let session = NFCNDEFReaderSession(delegate: self, queue: nil, invalidateAfterFirstRead: true)
        session.alertMessage = "Hold your iPhone near the NFC tag to write data."
        session.begin()
    }
}

func readerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession, didDetect tags: [NFCNDEFTag]) {
    if tags.count > 0 {
        let tag = tags[0]
        session.connect(to: tag) { (error) in
            if error == nil {
                let ndefMessage = NFCNDEFMessage(records: [NFCNDEFPayload.wellKnownTypeTextPayload(string: "Hello, NFC!")])
            }
        }
    }
}

// Other required methods of the NFCNDEFReaderSessionDelegate protocol
```
In the `writeNFCData()` method, create a new `NFCNDEFReaderSession` and start the session. When a tag is detected, the `didDetect` method is called. Inside this method, we connect to the tag and create an NDEF message with the payload data to be written to the NFC tag.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored how to use NFC for secure identity verification in a Swift app. We learned how to read NFC data using `NFCTagReaderSession` and write NFC data using `NFCNDEFReaderSession`. NFC technology provides a convenient and secure way to verify identities, making it a valuable tool for various applications.
