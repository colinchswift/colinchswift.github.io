NFC (Near Field Communication) technology allows devices to communicate wirelessly when they are in close proximity. It is commonly used for contactless payments, access control, and more. Another interesting use case for NFC is tracking and tracing assets, such as products or equipment, to monitor their location and status.

In this blog post, we will explore how to utilize NFC in a Swift application to track and trace assets. We will cover the following topics:

## Introduction to NFC

NFC is a technology that enables communication between devices at a close range (typically a few centimeters). It relies on radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to exchange data between devices. NFC tags, small passive devices embedded with an antenna, can be attached to assets and contain information that can be read or written by NFC-enabled devices.

## Setting Up the Project

To get started, create a new Swift project in Xcode. Make sure to enable the NFC capabilities for your app by enabling the "Near Field Communication Tag Reading" and "Near Field Communication Tag Writing" options in the project settings.

## Reading NFC Tags

To read NFC tags in your Swift app, you need to:

1. Import the CoreNFC framework.
2. Implement the `NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate` protocol.
3. Start a `NFCTagReaderSession` and handle the tag data.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to read NFC tags in Swift:

```swift
import CoreNFC

class NFCReaderViewController: UIViewController, NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate {
    var nfcSession: NFCTagReaderSession?
    
    func beginNFCReading() {
        nfcSession = NFCTagReaderSession(pollingOption: .iso14443, delegate: self)
        nfcSession?.begin()
    }
    
    func tagReaderSession(_ session: NFCTagReaderSession, didDetect tags: [NFCTag]) {
        for tag in tags {
            session.connect(to: tag) { (error: Error?) in
                if error != nil {
                    session.invalidate(errorMessage: "Error communicating with tag.")
                } else {
                    // Process the tag data
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    func tagReaderSessionDidBecomeActive(_ session: NFCTagReaderSession) {
        // Session became active
    }
    
    func tagReaderSession(_ session: NFCTagReaderSession, didInvalidateWithError error: Error) {
        // Session invalidated
    }
}
```

## Writing NFC Tags

Writing NFC tags in Swift follows a similar approach to reading tags. However, you need to implement the `NFCNDEFReaderSessionDelegate` protocol instead. Here is an example code snippet:

```swift
import CoreNFC

class NFCWriterViewController: UIViewController, NFCNDEFReaderSessionDelegate {
    var nfcSession: NFCNDEFReaderSession?
    
    func beginNFCWriting() {
        nfcSession = NFCNDEFReaderSession(delegate: self, queue: nil, invalidateAfterFirstRead: false)
        nfcSession?.begin()
    }
    
    func readerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession, didDetectNDEFs messages: [NFCNDEFMessage]) {
        // Process the received messages
    }
    
    func readerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession, didInvalidateWithError error: Error) {
        // Session invalidated
    }
}
```

## Tracking and Tracing Assets

To implement asset tracking and tracing with NFC in your Swift app, you can use a combination of reading and writing NFC tags. When an asset is scanned, you can retrieve its unique identifier from the tag and associate it with metadata such as location, timestamp, or any other relevant information.

By periodically scanning the tags, you can update the asset's location and track its movement. This information can be stored locally or sent to a server for further analysis and reporting.

## Conclusion

NFC technology provides a convenient way to track and trace assets in Swift applications. By utilizing the CoreNFC framework, you can read and write NFC tags, allowing you to monitor the location and status of assets. This opens up possibilities for various asset management and tracking solutions in a wide range of industries.

Remember to enable NFC capabilities for your app and handle the appropriate delegate methods to read and write NFC tags. With the information provided in this blog post, you should be well-equipped to start implementing asset tracking and tracing with NFC in your Swift app.
