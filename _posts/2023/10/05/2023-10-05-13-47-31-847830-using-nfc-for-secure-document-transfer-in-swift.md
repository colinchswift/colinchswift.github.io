In this tutorial, we will explore how to use Near Field Communication (NFC) to securely transfer documents between devices using Swift programming language. NFC is a short-range wireless communication technology that allows devices to exchange data when they are near each other. NFC is commonly used for contactless payments, ticketing, and sharing information between devices.

## Introduction to NFC

Near Field Communication (NFC) is a technology that enables communication between devices in close proximity, typically within a few centimeters. It operates at a frequency of 13.56 MHz and supports two modes: read/write and card emulation. NFC technology is based on RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) principles and provides a secure and convenient way to transfer data.

## NFC and Document Transfer

One of the use cases of NFC is secure document transfer between devices. This can be useful in scenarios where users need to share sensitive documents without relying on an internet connection or external servers. By utilizing NFC, documents can be securely transferred between devices in a quick and efficient manner.

## Setting up the Project

To get started, create a new Swift project in Xcode. Once the project is set up, we need to enable the NFC capability. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Select the project file in the Xcode navigator.
2. Go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab.
3. Click on the "+" button to add a new capability.
4. Search for "NFC" and select it from the list.
5. Enable "Near Field Communication Tag Reading" and "Near Field Communication Tag Writing."

## Implementing NFC

To start reading and writing NFC data, we need to import the CoreNFC framework into our project. Add the following import statement at the top of your Swift file:

```swift
import CoreNFC
```

Next, we need to conform to the `NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate` protocol to handle NFC tag reading. Create a new class and let it adopt the `NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate` protocol:

```swift
class NFCReaderViewController: UIViewController, NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate {
    // Class implementation goes here
}
```

## Handling Document Transfer

Once NFC communication is established, we can begin the process of document transfer. Here is an example of how we can handle the document transfer using NFC:

```swift
class NFCReaderViewController: UIViewController, NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate {
    // ...

    func tagReaderSession(_ session: NFCTagReaderSession, didDetect tags: [NFCTag]) {
        guard let tag = tags.first else {
            session.invalidate(errorMessage: "Unable to read NFC tag.")
            return
        }
        
        session.connect(to: tag) { (error: Error?) in
            if let error = error {
                session.invalidate(errorMessage: error.localizedDescription)
                return
            }
            
            if case let .iso7816(tag) = tag {
                tag.sendCommand(command APDU) { (response: Data, sw1: UInt8, sw2: UInt8, error: Error?) in
                    // Handle response and error here
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to use NFC for secure document transfer in Swift. We covered the basics of NFC, setting up the project, implementing NFC communication, and handling document transfer. By leveraging NFC, users can securely share sensitive documents between devices without relying on an internet connection or external servers. NFC provides a convenient and efficient way to transfer data in a secure manner. Start implementing NFC in your Swift projects and enhance the document transfer experience for your users.
