## Introduction

Near Field Communication (NFC) is a wireless technology that allows devices in close proximity to communicate with each other. It provides a convenient and secure method for transferring data between devices. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement NFC for secure cloud storage access in Swift.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need:

- Xcode installed on your machine
- An iPhone with NFC capabilities (iPhone 7 and later models)

## Setting up the project

1. Open Xcode and create a new Swift project.

2. Import the Core NFC framework by navigating to your project's settings, selecting the target, and then adding `CoreNFC.framework` to the frameworks and libraries section.

3. Create a new Swift file called `NFCManager.swift`.

## Implementing NFCManager

In the `NFCManager.swift` file, let's define a class called `NFCManager`.

```swift
import CoreNFC

class NFCManager: NSObject, NFCNDEFReaderSessionDelegate {

    var nfcSession: NFCNDEFReaderSession?

    func beginListening() {
        nfcSession = NFCNDEFReaderSession(delegate: self, queue: nil, invalidateAfterFirstRead: false)
        nfcSession?.begin()
    }

    func readerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession, didInvalidateWithError error: Error) {
        // Handle session invalidation error
    }

    func readerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession, didDetectNDEFs messages: [NFCNDEFMessage]) {
        // Handle NFC tag detection
    }
}
```

In the `NFCManager` class, we conform to the `NFCNDEFReaderSessionDelegate` protocol to handle NFC reading events.

## Starting an NFC session

Inside your view controller, create an instance of `NFCManager` and start an NFC session.

```swift
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    let nfcManager = NFCManager()

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        nfcManager.beginListening()
    }
}
```

By calling `beginListening()` on the `nfcManager` instance, we start listening for NFC tags in the vicinity.

## Handling NFC tag detection

To handle NFC tag detection, implement the `readerSession(_:didDetectNDEFs:)` method in the `NFCManager` class. Here, you can extract the payload from the NFC tag and perform the necessary authentication logic against your cloud storage service.

```swift
func readerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession, didDetectNDEFs messages: [NFCNDEFMessage]) {
    guard let message = messages.first else {
        return
    }
    
    for record in message.records {
        let payload = String(data: record.payload, encoding: .utf8)
        // Perform authentication against cloud storage service
    }
}
```

In the above code, we are iterating through the records in the `NFCNDEFMessage` to extract the payload (data) from the NFC tag.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have explored how to implement NFC for secure cloud storage access in Swift. NFC provides a convenient and secure method for accessing cloud storage services using compatible NFC-enabled devices. With this knowledge, you can now build applications that leverage NFC technology for authentication and secure data transfer.
