## What is NFC?
Near Field Communication (NFC) is a short-range wireless technology that allows for contactless communication between devices. It enables devices to establish a connection by simply bringing them close together, typically within a few centimeters.

## Benefits of NFC in Supply Chain Visibility
Integrating NFC into a supply chain management system offers several benefits, including:

1. **Real-time tracking**: NFC tags can be attached to products or packaging to provide real-time tracking information. This allows for improved visibility and enables businesses to track the movement and location of goods throughout the supply chain.

2. **Authentication and verification**: NFC tags can be used to authenticate products and verify their authenticity. This helps in reducing the risk of counterfeiting and ensures the integrity of the supply chain.

3. **Efficient data collection**: NFC tags can store relevant information about a product, such as manufacturing date, batch number, and expiration date. By scanning these tags using an NFC-enabled device, supply chain stakeholders can easily access and record data, reducing manual data entry errors and improving efficiency.

4. **Streamlined inventory management**: NFC technology can simplify inventory management by enabling automatic updates to the inventory system when tagged items are received, shipped, or moved within the supply chain. This reduces the need for manual inventory counts, saving time and reducing errors.

## Integration Steps
To integrate NFC into a supply chain management system using Swift, the following steps can be followed:

1. **Hardware selection**: Choose an NFC-enabled device (such as an iPhone or iPad) that supports the required NFC functionalities. Ensure that the device is compatible with the NFC tag types you plan to use.

2. **Tag selection**: Select NFC tags that are suitable for your supply chain requirements. There are various types of NFC tags available, including sticker tags, keychains, and embeddable tags.

3. **NFC framework configuration**: Configure the NFC framework in your Swift project by adding the necessary dependencies and permissions. This can be done by adding the required dependencies in your project's `Podfile` and updating the project.

4. **Handling NFC interactions**: Implement the necessary logic for reading and writing NFC data in your Swift code. This includes handling NFC session setup, detecting nearby NFC tags, and processing the data read from or written to the tags.

## Reading NFC Data
To read NFC data using Swift, you need to follow these steps:

1. Import the required NFC framework:
   
   ```swift
   import CoreNFC
   ```

2. Implement the `NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate` protocol to handle NFC tag reading callbacks.

3. Start an NFC session and handle the tag detection event:

   ```swift
   let session = NFCTagReaderSession(pollingOption: [.iso14443], delegate: self)
   session.begin()
   ```

4. Implement the `tagReaderSession(_:didDetect:)` method to handle the detected tags:

   ```swift
   func tagReaderSession(_ session: NFCTagReaderSession, didDetect tags: [NFCTag]) {
       guard let firstTag = tags.first else {
           return
       }
       
       session.connect(to: firstTag) { (error: Error?) in
           guard error == nil else {
               session.invalidate(errorMessage: "Connection failed")
               return
           }
           
           // Read NFC data and process it
       }
   }
   ```

## Writing NFC Data
To write data to an NFC tag using Swift, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of `NFCNDEFMessage` to hold the data you want to write to the NFC tag.

2. Convert your data into `NFCNDEFPayload` objects and add them to the message.

3. Implement the `tagReaderSession(_:didDetect:)` method to handle the NFC tag detection event, similar to reading NFC data.

4. Before writing to the tag, authenticate and connect to it using the `session.connect(to: firstTag)` method.

5. Write the NFC message to the tag using the `tag.writeNDEF(message: completionHandler:)` method:

   ```swift
   tag.writeNDEF(message: message) { (error: Error?) in
       if error != nil {
           session.invalidate(errorMessage: "Write failed")
       } else {
           session.alertMessage = "Write successful"
           session.invalidate()
       }
   }
   ```

## Conclusion
Integrating NFC technology into a supply chain management system using Swift provides numerous benefits, including real-time tracking, authentication, efficient data collection, and streamlined inventory management. By following the integration steps outlined in this blog post, you can leverage NFC capabilities to enhance supply chain visibility and improve operational efficiency.
