Near Field Communication (NFC) is a technology that allows devices to communicate with each other by bringing them close together. With the introduction of the Core NFC framework in iOS 11, developers can now read and write NFC tags using their iPhone or iPad.

In this article, we'll explore how to parse NFC data in Swift, allowing you to extract meaningful information from NFC tags.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with the examples in this tutorial, you'll need the following:

- An iOS device with NFC capabilities running iOS 11 or later
- Xcode 12 or later
- Basic knowledge of Swift programming

## Getting Started

1. Create a new Xcode project or open an existing one.
2. Enable the Near Field Communication Tag Reading capability for your project by navigating to the project editor, selecting your target, and then enabling the "Near Field Communication Tag Reading" capability.

## Parsing NFC Data

The first step in parsing NFC data is to set up an instance of `NFCTagReaderSession` and conform to the `NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate` protocol. The `NFCTagReaderSession` will handle the scanning and reading of NFC tags.

```swift
import CoreNFC

class NFCReaderViewController: UIViewController, NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate {
    var nfcTagReaderSession: NFCTagReaderSession?
    
    func beginScanning() {
        nfcTagReaderSession = NFCTagReaderSession(pollingOption: .iso14443, delegate: self)
        nfcTagReaderSession?.begin()
    }
    
    func tagReaderSession(_ session: NFCTagReaderSession, didDetect tags: [NFCTag]) {
        if let firstTag = tags.first {
            session.connect(to: firstTag) { (error) in
                if let error = error {
                    print("Error connecting to tag: \(error.localizedDescription)")
                    return
                }
                
                // Tag connected, handle NFC data parsing here
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Implement the remaining required methods of NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate
}
```

In the `beginScanning` method, we create an instance of `NFCTagReaderSession` and start scanning for NFC tags using the `.iso14443` polling option. Once a tag is detected, the `tagReaderSession(_:didDetect:)` delegate method is called.

Inside the `tagReaderSession(_:didDetect:)` method, we connect to the detected tag using the `connect(to:completionHandler:)` method. If the connection is successful, we can proceed with parsing the NFC data.

## Extracting NFC Data

To extract data from an NFC tag, we need to know the format of the data stored on the tag. NFC tags can store different types of data, such as URLs, text, or custom formats. Let's look at an example of extracting a URL from an NFC tag.

```swift
func handleNFCData(_ data: Data) {
    let payload = NFCNDEFPayload.init(data: data)

    if payload.typeNameFormat == .absoluteURI, let url = payload.wellKnownTypeURIPayload() {
        print("URL: \(url)")
    }
}
```

In the `handleNFCData` method, we create an instance of `NFCNDEFPayload` with the data retrieved from the NFC tag. We then check the `typeNameFormat` property to determine the format of the data. In this example, we're interested in an absolute URI, so we use the `wellKnownTypeURIPayload` method to extract the URL.

## Putting It All Together

To parse NFC data in a real-world scenario, you would need to handle different data formats and customize the parsing logic according to your needs. The examples provided in this article should give you a good starting point for working with NFC data in Swift.

Remember to handle error cases and implement the remaining required methods of the `NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate` protocol to ensure a robust and reliable NFC reading experience for your users.

# Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to parse NFC data in Swift using the Core NFC framework. We explored how to set up an `NFCTagReaderSession`, detect NFC tags, and extract meaningful data from the tags. NFC technology opens up a wide range of possibilities for creating interactive experiences in your iOS apps, so go ahead and start experimenting with it in your own projects!
