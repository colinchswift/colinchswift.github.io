## What is NFC?

Near Field Communication (NFC) is a short-range wireless technology that allows devices to communicate by bringing them close together. NFC can be used for various purposes, including mobile payments, ticketing systems, and user authentication.

## Setting up the project

To get started, create a new Swift project in Xcode. Make sure your device or simulator supports NFC capabilities.

Next, import the Core NFC framework by adding the following code to your project's Podfile:

```
pod 'CoreNFC'
```

Run `pod install` to install the dependencies and open the `.xcworkspace` file.

## Reading NFC tags

To read NFC tags, we need to conform to the NFCNDEFReaderSessionDelegate protocol. Create a new class and implement the methods:

```swift
import CoreNFC

class NFCReader: NSObject, NFCNDEFReaderSessionDelegate {
    
    var nfcSession: NFCNDEFReaderSession?
    
    func startReading() {
        nfcSession = NFCNDEFReaderSession(delegate: self, queue: DispatchQueue.main, invalidateAfterFirstRead: true)
        nfcSession?.begin()
    }
    
    func readerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession, didDetectNDEFs messages: [NFCNDEFMessage]) {
        guard let nfcTag = messages.first?.records.first else {
            // No NFC tag detected
            return
        }
        
        // Process the NFC tag data
        let payload = String(data: nfcTag.payload, encoding: .utf8)
        print("NFC Tag Payload: \(payload ?? "")")
    }
    
    func readerSession(_ session: NFCNDEFReaderSession, didInvalidateWithError error: Error) {
        // Handle any errors during reading
        print("NFC Reader Session error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```

In the `startReading` method, we initialize an instance of `NFCNDEFReaderSession` and begin the session. In the `didDetectNDEFs` method, we get the payload data from the NFC tag and process it. In the `didInvalidateWithError` method, we handle any errors that occur during reading.

## Verifying user authentication

Once we have read the NFC tag data, we can use it to authenticate the user. The specific authentication process may vary depending on your application requirements. You can compare the NFC tag data with a stored value or use it as a unique identifier for the user.

For example, you can authenticate the user by comparing the NFC tag payload with a stored user ID:

```swift
func authenticateUser(nfcTagPayload: String) -> Bool {
    let storedUserID = "exampleUserID"
    return nfcTagPayload == storedUserID
}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to authenticate users using NFC in Swift. We set up the project, read NFC tags, and verified user authentication. NFC can offer a convenient and secure way to authenticate users in various applications. By leveraging this technology, you can enhance the user experience and increase the security of your app.
