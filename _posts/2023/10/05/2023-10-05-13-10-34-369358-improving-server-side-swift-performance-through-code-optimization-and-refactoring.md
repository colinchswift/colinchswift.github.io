## Use proper data structures

Choosing the right data structure is crucial for optimal performance. Swift provides various collection types such as arrays, dictionaries, and sets. Consider the specific requirements of your application and select the most appropriate data structure.

For example, if you frequently need to perform lookup operations based on unique keys, using a dictionary can provide faster access times compared to arrays. On the other hand, if you need to maintain ordered data, an array might be a better choice.

## Avoid unnecessary operations

Performing unnecessary operations can have a significant impact on performance. Avoid repetitive calculations or duplicate operations whenever possible. 

For instance, if you have a complex calculation that can be cached or memoized, store the result and reuse it instead of recomputing it multiple times. Additionally, make use of Swift's lazy properties to defer expensive computations until they are actually needed.

Another common pitfall is unnecessary string concatenation. In Swift, string concatenation can be expensive due to memory allocations and copying. Instead, consider using `StringBuilder` or other efficient string manipulation techniques to minimize performance overhead.

## Profile and identify hotspots

Profiling your code is vital for identifying performance bottlenecks and areas that need optimization. Swift provides profiling tools like Instruments that can help you measure CPU usage, memory allocation, and identify hotspots.

By profiling your code, you can focus your optimization efforts on the parts of your codebase that have the most impact on performance.

## Implement asynchronous operations

In server-side Swift, performing I/O or network-bound tasks synchronously can significantly impact performance. Use asynchronous operations and non-blocking I/O whenever possible. Swift's async/await concurrency model introduced in Swift 5.5 makes it easier to write asynchronous code.

By executing tasks concurrently and not blocking the main thread, your server-side application can handle multiple requests efficiently, resulting in improved performance.

## Minimize database queries

When working with databases in server-side Swift, minimizing the number of queries can greatly enhance performance. Try to consolidate multiple database operations into a single query whenever possible, reducing the overhead caused by multiple round trips.

Another optimization technique is to utilize caching. By caching frequently accessed data in memory, you can avoid unnecessary database lookups and improve response times.

## Conclusion

Optimizing and refactoring your server-side Swift code can lead to significant improvements in performance and efficiency. By using proper data structures, avoiding unnecessary operations, profiling your code, implementing asynchronous operations, and minimizing database queries, you can achieve better server-side Swift performance. Remember to constantly monitor and measure the impact of your optimizations to ensure you are on the right track.
