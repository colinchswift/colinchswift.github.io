In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using mobile devices for secure and convenient voting systems. Near Field Communication (NFC) technology has emerged as a reliable method for verifying the authenticity of voters and ensuring the integrity of the voting process. In this blog post, we will explore how to integrate NFC functionality into a mobile voting system using Swift.

## What is NFC?

NFC is a short-range wireless communication technology that allows devices to establish a connection by simply bringing them close together. It operates on the same frequency as RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology and is widely used for contactless payments, access control, and data sharing.

For mobile voting systems, NFC can be utilized to securely transmit voter information, such as voter ID and ballot selections, between a mobile device and an NFC reader.

## Setting Up the Project

To get started, create a new Xcode project and select the "Single View App" template. Make sure to choose Swift as the development language.

## Enabling NFC Capability

The first step is to enable NFC capability for your app. Open the project's `Info.plist` file and add the following key-value pair:

```swift
<key>NFCReaderUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow this app to read NFC tags for secure voting.</string>
```

This will display a permission prompt to the user the first time they attempt to use NFC functionality in your app.

## Detecting NFC Tags

To detect an NFC tag, we need to implement the `NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate` protocol. Inside your view controller, add the following code:

```swift
import CoreNFC

class ViewController: UIViewController, NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate {
    var nfcSession: NFCTagReaderSession?

    // Function to start an NFC session
    func startNFCSession() {
        nfcSession = NFCTagReaderSession(pollingOption: .iso14443, delegate: self)
        nfcSession?.begin()
    }

    // Delegate method called when a tag is detected
    func tagReaderSession(_ session: NFCTagReaderSession, didDetect tags: [NFCTag]) {
        guard let tag = tags.first else {
            session.invalidate(errorMessage: "Cannot read the NFC tag.")
            return
        }

        // Process the NFC tag data
        // ...
    }

    // Delegate method called when the session is invalidated
    func tagReaderSessionDidBecomeInactive(_ session: NFCTagReaderSession) {
        // Cleanup and reset UI if needed
        // ...
    }

    // Delegate method called when the session is terminated
    func tagReaderSession(_ session: NFCTagReaderSession, didInvalidateWithError error: Error) {
        // Handle any errors that occurred during the session
        // ...
    }
}
```

The `startNFCSession` function initializes an `NFCTagReaderSession` with `.iso14443` polling option, which is commonly used for NFC tags. The `didDetect` method is called when a tag is detected, and `didInvalidateWithError` is called when the session is terminated.

## Reading NFC Tag Data

To read the data from the NFC tag, we need to implement the following methods inside the `tagReaderSession(_:didDetect:)` delegate method:

```swift
// Function to read the NFC tag data
func readTagData(from tag: NFCTag) {
    session.connect(to: tag) { (error: Error?) in
        if error != nil {
            session.invalidate(errorMessage: "Connecting to the tag failed.")
        }

        switch tag {
        case .miFare(let miFareTag):
            // Read the data from the miFareTag
            // ...

        case .ISO15693(let iso15693Tag):
            // Read the data from the iso15693Tag
            // ...

        default:
            session.invalidate(errorMessage: "Unsupported tag type.")
        }
    }
}
```

Inside the respective cases for supported tag types, you can extract the required data from the NFC tag.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to integrate NFC functionality into a mobile voting system using Swift. We explored the basics of NFC technology, enabling NFC capability in Xcode, detecting NFC tags, and reading data from them.

NFC integration not only enhances the convenience of voting systems but also ensures the security and integrity of the entire process. With the power of Swift and CoreNFC framework, developers can create robust and reliable mobile voting applications.
