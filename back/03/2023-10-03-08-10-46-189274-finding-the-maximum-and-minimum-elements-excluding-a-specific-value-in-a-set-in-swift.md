In Swift, you can easily find the maximum and minimum elements in a set using the `max()` and `min()` functions respectively. However, if you want to exclude a specific value while finding the maximum and minimum, you'll need to perform an additional step. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
let set: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
let excludedValue = 4

// Filter out the excluded value from the set
let filteredSet = set.filter { $0 != excludedValue }

// Find the maximum and minimum elements in the filtered set
let maxValue = filteredSet.max()
let minValue = filteredSet.min()

if let maxValue = maxValue {
    print("Maximum value: \(maxValue)")
} else {
    print("No maximum value found")
}

if let minValue = minValue {
    print("Minimum value: \(minValue)")
} else {
    print("No minimum value found")
}
```

In the above code, we first define a set `set` containing a range of integers. We also define the `excludedValue` variable which we want to exclude while finding the maximum and minimum.

We then use the `filter` function to create a new set `filteredSet` where the excluded value is removed. The `filter` function takes a closure that specifies the condition for inclusion in the new set. In this case, we filter out any element that is equal to the `excludedValue`.

Finally, we use the `max()` and `min()` functions on the `filteredSet` to find the maximum and minimum values respectively. If a maximum or minimum value is found, we print it out. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that no maximum or minimum value was found.

With this approach, you can easily find the maximum and minimum elements in a set while excluding a specific value in Swift.
