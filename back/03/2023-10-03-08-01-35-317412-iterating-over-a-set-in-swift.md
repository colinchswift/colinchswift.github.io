To iterate over a set in Swift, follow these steps:

1. Declare a set and initialize it with some values:
```swift
var fruitSet: Set<String> = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
```

2. Use the `for-in` loop to iterate over the set:
```swift
for fruit in fruitSet {
    print(fruit)
}
```

This will print each element of the set on a new line.

You can also perform operations on each element during iteration. For example, you can use the `isEmpty` property to check if the set is empty before iterating:
```swift
if !fruitSet.isEmpty {
    for fruit in fruitSet {
        print("I love \(fruit)s!")
    }
} else {
    print("Oops! The fruit set is empty.")
}
```

In this example, it checks if the set is not empty before iterating and printing a message for each fruit.

Remember, sets in Swift do not guarantee a specific order, so the iteration order may vary each time you run the code.
