Sets in Swift are a powerful data structure for storing unique and unordered values. Sometimes, we might need to combine multiple sets to create a new set that contains the values from all the individual sets. In Swift, we can achieve this using a binary operation called the union operation.

The union operation on sets takes two sets as input and returns a new set that contains all the unique values from both sets. Let's explore how to use this operation in Swift.

## Union Operation in Swift

To use the union operation in Swift, we can call the `union(_:)` method on a set and pass another set as an argument. The method will return a new set that contains all the elements from both sets.

Here's an example that demonstrates the union operation:

```swift
var fruits: Set<String> = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"]
var vegetables: Set<String> = ["Carrot", "Broccoli", "Tomato"]

let combinedSet = fruits.union(vegetables)
print(combinedSet) // Output: ["Apple", "Banana", "Broccoli", "Tomato", "Carrot", "Mango"]
```

In the above example, we have two sets: `fruits` and `vegetables`. We call the `union(_:)` method on the `fruits` set and pass the `vegetables` set as an argument. The result is a new set `combinedSet` that contains all the unique elements from both sets.

## Combining Multiple Sets

To combine multiple sets, we can perform the union operation consecutively on each set. We can use the result of the previous union operation as the first set for the next union operation.

Here's an example that combines three sets:

```swift
var set1: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3]
var set2: Set<Int> = [3, 4, 5]
var set3: Set<Int> = [5, 6, 7]

let combinedSet = set1.union(set2).union(set3)
print(combinedSet) // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

In the above example, the `combinedSet` is calculated by performing the union operation twice: first on `set1` and `set2`, and then on the result of that operation and `set3`. The final result is a new set that contains all the unique elements from all three sets.

## Conclusion

The union operation in Swift allows us to combine multiple sets into a new set that contains all the unique elements. By using the `union(_:)` method, we can easily perform this operation. Combining sets can be useful when dealing with various data or when merging multiple collections into one.
