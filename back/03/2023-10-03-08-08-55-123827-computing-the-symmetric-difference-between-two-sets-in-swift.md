When working with sets in Swift, it's common to perform various operations to manipulate and compare sets. One such operation is finding the symmetric difference between two sets. The symmetric difference of two sets contains elements that are present in one of the sets but not in both.

In Swift, we can conveniently compute the symmetric difference between two sets using the `symmetricDifference(_:)` method. Let's take a look at an example:

```swift
let set1: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let set2: Set<Int> = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

let symmetricDifference = set1.symmetricDifference(set2)
print(symmetricDifference) // Output: [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8]
```

In the above example, we have two sets `set1` and `set2`. We then use the `symmetricDifference(_:)` method to compute the symmetric difference between these two sets. The result is stored in the `symmetricDifference` constant, which will contain the elements [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8].

It's important to note that the `symmetricDifference(_:)` method returns a new set containing the elements from both sets excluding the common elements. It does not modify the existing sets.

Now that you know how to compute the symmetric difference between two sets in Swift, you can use this operation whenever you need to compare and manipulate sets with ease!

Let me know if this was helpful! üëç
