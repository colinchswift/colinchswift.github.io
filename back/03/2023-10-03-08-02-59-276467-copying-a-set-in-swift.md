In Swift, you can create a copy of a `Set` using the `Set` initializer or by using the `Set` copy method. Both methods allow you to create a copy of the original `Set` while still maintaining its uniqueness and the order of its elements.

Using the `Set` Initializer:

```swift
let originalSet: Set<String> = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
let copiedSet = Set(originalSet)
```

In the code above, we define an original `Set` called `originalSet` with three elements. We then create a copy of `originalSet` using the `Set` initializer and assign it to the variable `copiedSet`.

Using the `Set` Copy Method:

```swift
let originalSet: Set<String> = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
let copiedSet = originalSet.copy()
```

In the code above, we define the original `Set` called `originalSet` with three elements. We then use the `copy()` method to create a copy of `originalSet` and assign it to the variable `copiedSet`.

Both methods will create a new `Set` that contains the same elements as the original `Set`. Modifying the copied `Set` will not affect the original `Set` and vice versa.

It is important to note that the copy operation creates a new instance of `Set`, so any changes made to the copied `Set` will not affect the original `Set`.

By copying a `Set`, you can create a duplicate copy of the original `Set` and perform operations or modifications independently on each set without affecting the other.

#swift #set #copy
