Here is an example code snippet demonstrating how to use this method:

```swift
let numbers: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

let noneGreaterThanTen = !numbers.contains { $0 > 10 }
print(noneGreaterThanTen) // Output: true

let noneLessThanZero = !numbers.contains { $0 < 0 }
print(noneLessThanZero) // Output: true

let noneEven = !numbers.contains { $0 % 2 == 0 }
print(noneEven) // Output: false
```

In the above code, we have a set of numbers, `numbers`, and we are checking if any of the elements in `numbers` satisfy certain conditions. 

The `contains(where:)` method is used with a closure that checks if an element is greater than 10, less than 0, or even. By negating the result of `contains`, we are checking if none of the elements satisfy the given condition. If none of the elements satisfy the condition, the result is `true`; otherwise, it's `false`.
