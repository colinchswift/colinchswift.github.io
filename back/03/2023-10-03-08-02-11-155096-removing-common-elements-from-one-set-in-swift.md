In Swift, sets are unordered collections of unique elements. Sometimes, we may need to remove common elements between two sets and keep only the unique elements from one of the sets. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as filtering out duplicates or finding the unique elements in a dataset.

In this blog post, we will explore how to remove common elements from one set in Swift using various approaches. Let's dive in!

## Approach 1: Using the `subtract` method

One straightforward way to remove common elements from a set is by using the `subtract` method. The `subtract` method removes elements contained in another set from the current set.

Here's an example:

```swift
var set1: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let set2: Set<Int> = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

set1.subtract(set2)
// set1 now contains [1, 2, 3]
```

In the example above, we have two sets (`set1` and `set2`). We subtract `set2` from `set1`, and as a result, `set1` only contains elements that are not present in `set2`.

## Approach 2: Using the set subtraction operator (`-`)

Another way to remove common elements from a set is by using the set subtraction operator (`-`). This operator returns a new set that contains elements from the first set that are not present in the second set.

Here's an example:

```swift
var set1: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let set2: Set<Int> = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

set1 = set1 - set2
// set1 now contains [1, 2, 3]
```

In the example above, we subtract `set2` from `set1` using the set subtraction operator, and assign the result back to `set1`. As a result, `set1` only contains elements that are not present in `set2`.

## Conclusion

Removing common elements from one set in Swift can be achieved using either the `subtract` method or the set subtraction operator (`-`). Both approaches provide a convenient way to filter out common elements and keep only the unique elements from one set.

Remember to choose the approach that best suits your code's readability and maintainability. Happy coding!
