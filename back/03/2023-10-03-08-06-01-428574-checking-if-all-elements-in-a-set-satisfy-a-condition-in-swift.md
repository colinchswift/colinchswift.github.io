Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use the `allSatisfy` method:

```swift
var numbers: Set<Int> = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

let allEven = numbers.allSatisfy { $0 % 2 == 0 }
if allEven {
    print("All elements in the set are even numbers.")
} else {
    print("Not all elements in the set are even numbers.")
}
```

In the above code, we have a set called `numbers` that contains some integer values. We then use the `allSatisfy` method to check if all elements in the set are even numbers by providing a closure that checks if the remainder of dividing each element by 2 is 0. If all elements satisfy the condition, the `allEven` variable will be `true`, and we print a message indicating that all elements in the set are even numbers. Otherwise, if not all elements satisfy the condition, the `allEven` variable will be `false`, and we print a different message.

By using the `allSatisfy` method, you can easily check if all elements in a set meet a certain condition without iterating through the set manually, making your code more concise and readable.

#swift #set #condition #allSatisfy
