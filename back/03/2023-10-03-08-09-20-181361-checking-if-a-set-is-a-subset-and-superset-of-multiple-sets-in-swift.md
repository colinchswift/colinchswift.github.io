When working with sets in Swift, you may come across situations where you need to check if a set is a subset or a superset of multiple sets. In this article, we will explore how to perform these checks efficiently using Swift's Set data structure.

## Subset Check

To determine if a set `A` is a subset of multiple sets `B`, `C`, and `D`, we can leverage the `isSubset(of:)` method provided by the `Set` class. This method checks if every element in `A` is also a member of `B`, `C`, and `D`.

```swift
let setA: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3]
let setB: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let setC: Set<Int> = [1, 2]
let setD: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4]

let isSubset = setA.isSubset(of: [setB, setC, setD])
print(isSubset) // true
```

In the above example, `setA` is a subset of `setB`, `setC`, and `setD`, so the output will be `true`.

## Superset Check

To check if a set `A` is a superset of multiple sets `B`, `C`, and `D`, we can use the `isSuperset(of:)` method provided by the `Set` class. This method checks if every element in `B`, `C`, and `D` is also a member of `A`.

```swift
let setA: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4]
let setB: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3]
let setC: Set<Int> = [1, 2]
let setD: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

let isSuperset = setA.isSuperset(of: [setB, setC, setD])
print(isSuperset) // false
```

In the above example, `setA` is not a superset of `setB`, `setC`, and `setD`, as there are elements in `setD` that are not present in `setA`. Hence, the output will be `false`.

## Conclusion

Swift's Set class provides convenient methods to check if a set is a subset or superset of multiple sets. By using these methods, you can efficiently perform these checks and make informed decisions based on the results. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to validate the relationships between sets in your code.
