In Swift, a set is a collection type that stores unordered and unique values of the same type. If you have two sets and want to combine them into a single set without any duplicate values, you can use the `union` method provided by Swift's `Set` type.

Here's an example of how to combine two sets in Swift:

```swift
// Define two sets
let set1: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4]
let set2: Set<Int> = [3, 4, 5, 6]

// Use the union method to combine the sets
let combinedSet = set1.union(set2)

// Print the combined set
print(combinedSet)
```

The output will be:

```
[5, 2, 4, 1, 6, 3]
```

As you can see, the `union` method combines the values from both sets, removing any duplicates. The resulting set is an unordered collection of all unique elements.

It's important to note that the `union` method doesn't modify the original sets, but rather returns a new set with the combined values.

In addition to `union`, Swift's `Set` type provides other useful methods to perform set operations, such as `intersection`, `symmetricDifference`, and `subtracting`. These methods can be handy when working with sets in Swift.
