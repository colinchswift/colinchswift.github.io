Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to check if a set is a superset of another set:

```swift
let set1: Set<String> = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
let set2: Set<String> = ["apple", "orange"]

if set1.isSuperset(of: set2) {
    print("set1 is a superset of set2")
} else {
    print("set1 is not a superset of set2")
}
```

In the above example, we have two sets, `set1` and `set2`. We use the `isSuperset(of:)` method to check if `set1` is a superset of `set2`. If the method returns `true`, it means that `set1` contains all the elements of `set2`, making it a superset.

You can customize the code as per your requirements by replacing the set elements and performing the superset check on any two sets of your choice.

Remember to import the `Foundation` framework to use the `Set` data type and related methods in Swift.
